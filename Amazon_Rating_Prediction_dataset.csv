0,"I purchased these headphones for my office work, and I am not disappointed. The earpads are big and therefore very comfortable (unlike those ""gaming"" headsets which either cover your entire ear and makes your ears go hot, or those on-ear headsets that press so hard against your ears that they hurt by the end of the day). The microphone stick extends both ways, and the earpads fold down completely as well. Quality is FANTASTIC - very high quality indeed. The volume control and mute/unmute buttons are soft and you can tell the quality once you use them - just brilliant. For someone like me who uses headsets for over 4 hours a day, these are great. The volume is not very high like other reviewers have pointed out, and for me that's probably good - I wouldn't want to have super loud sound in my ears for 4+ hours a day. Microphone quality is really good for me - I tried the recording using Mac/Windows and the sound quality for me is crisp, sharp and captures my voice well. If you are looking for solid quality headsets for work meetings, I would definitely recommend. For music, I am sure there are better alternatives.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Most recommended!",4.0 out of 5 stars
4," I brought it after my previous sennheiser headphone PC8 stopped working (used it for 5years). I mostly use it for office calls.Pros:- Very good sound quality- Build quality is better than previous one- 180° speaker folding- Noise cancelling microphone- Mute function works in sync with MS Teams and Cisco Webex. Same is for volume control.- Red light indicator for mute function.Cons:- With Summer Heat, It sweats on the ears after one hour use.",4.0 out of 5 stars

9,"After all research to find a good , actually working noise cancellation headset, I found pc8. 2. Noice cancellation actually working. Other side people will not receive any background noice. It will surprace 95% of background noice. Other headset with same working feature are costly, not sure why that much costly in retail because same jabra headset gating in corporate in half of the price. In many other head set company claming noise cancelling but that actually not working but with pc8. 2 it's working as claimed in description. so go for it, if your are looking for a headset for call and meeting with working noise cancelling feature .",5.0 out of 5 stars

30,I placed order in 25th July 2022.I am writing this review after 1 year of usage. The below is my personal experience.Microphone(5/5): is great with noise cancellation.Speaker(3/5): it is average audibly. If a low voice person speaks in other end it will be difficult for you to hear him/her as this is on-the-ear speaker and not over-the-ear speakers.Instument(3/5): The microphone part stopped working on certain angle for me from few months ago. So nowadays I am doing a microphone test on certain angle before joining a meeting.,3.0 out of 5 stars
31,It is budget friendly and works really well when it comes to noise cancellation.Audio clarity is great. The one hiccup that comes in between is the comfort when you use it for really long even after adjusting the length of supporters based on our length it will be a bit discomfortable other than that if we are using for a short time it is really good.,5.0 out of 5 stars

But, Amazon delivered the headphone without fail, and that too before time.ABOUT THE HEADPHONEIt is a great but at this price.I am a teacher.I use this headphone exclusively for online teaching.So, I needed a Bluetooth headphone which should take shorter duration to charge, but should give longer battery time.It takes roughly around 2 hours and 30 minutes to charge fully.And, after the full charge it gives me anywhere between 20 hours to 22 hours of runtime.The earcups completely covers my ears. This prevents external noises from interfering.The sound transmission and reception quality is exceptionally very good.My students can hear me loud and clear. I also can hear them loud and clear.LOOKS CUTEThe headphone is very cute. The colour combination is catchy/eye Turner.WILL I BUY AGAIN?Of course, I will.Being an online teacher, I do need backup devices.WILL I RECOMMEND TO OTHERS?I surely will recommend this headphone to my students and friends.This headphone is also good for watching YouTube videos and films, listening to music, and for telephonic talks.",5.0 out of 5 stars

139,"I recently purchased these headphones and was impressed by their excellent noise cancellation and stylish design. The noise cancellation feature effectively blocked out ambient sounds, allowing me to immerse myself in my music without any disturbances. The sleek and modern appearance of the headphones is also a plus.However, I did find the audio quality to be just average. While the sound was clear and balanced, it lacked the depth and richness that I was hoping for. Despite this drawback, the headphones still managed to deliver an enjoyable listening experience, especially when paired with genres that don't heavily rely on intricate audio details. Overall, if you prioritize noise cancellation and aesthetics, these headphones are worth considering, though audiophiles might want to explore other options for superior sound quality.",3.0 out of 5 stars

159,"Well I had a notion that cheap bt headphones could not produce good sound.. Well I was wrong.. N Im glad .. I use iem, in ear wired headphones usually.. Used sony skullcandy soundmagic kz.. M not gonna say its better then all of the above but u will be satisfied with the product.. Sound quality is awesome.. Bass is good not like in ear..but still wonderful and enough .. U cant have the effect of an in ear earphones bass quality in a cheap bt.. For that u need to spend at least 10k I think.. It has a passive sound isolation.. Nd its great.. Due to its fit and the foam half of the outer noise gets substacted just by putting it on.. Then the rest go out while the music is on.. Dual mode is good.. But don't think anyone would use the normal mode.. Cant use the phone eq on nt headphones thats a down side.. But u can use other third party eq or the eq in Spotify or saavn works.. The headphones itself might feel it could break cos all of it is made of plastic.. But feels like its a good one... And wont break .. The pads are soft it dosent hurt the head or the ear.. Used it for hours.. Been hearing from a lot of review about the sound quality of these.. But believe me most of them r giving the review after using it for the first time.. Headphone guide 101 u need to burn the drivers I mean u need to use the headphones for a couple of days to get its full potential.. And sound quality is very good.. Vocals are easyly separated bass is enough.. Treble is the right amount (the way I like it) sound stage is good due to being a on ear with big dynamic driver.. And u would feel the richness of the sound cos of the brand.. A better headphone is the one which creates good and detailed sound.. Not those who are loud.. So yeah I would recommend this over boat. And one last thing.. Due to it being only a bt headphone and no aux cable is available.. The sound quality deepeneds on the device ur using the Bluetooth quality and the amount of sound out put it can produce.. U can charge it with ur nrml charger if its 5v .. Do not use fast charger.. Been using it for two days now.. Need to burn them drivers more.. And will update on the sound quality.. And yeah the battery back up is really good have used it for almost 4/5 hours still 70% charge left.. It shows in the bt connectivity sec on ur phone.. At the end if ur looking for a headphone with a good premium look a well reputed brand and great sound quality do buy this without a doubt.. This r satisfactory very much.. Go for it.P. S Amazon delivery is really not up to the mark.. Even being a reputed company and all ow and another thing saw some complain about it being manufactured in china mine says manufactured in Malaysia.. Yes its a original one have registered it with harman audio..",4.0 out of 5 stars
160,For users like me who don't require very loud volumes but instead a quality in the sound this is a best option. The sound is also actually loud enough even for those using headphones in full volume.The dual channel sound is perfect.The only major drawback is the comfort which is not found in the device and it starts paining after each episode (~40 mins). Which is a real pain in the ears for those binge watchers like me.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Contacted amazon and finally jbl website too, One of the service call center rep said ""product is out of warranty"". Thats their knowledge. And their quote be like""Physical damage can't be covered in the 1yr warranty period"". They gave one solution there is 10% discount on the item purchase in jbl site. Who else wants to buy the 'poor built quality' product again?. And also the product is slightly uncomfortable may be a chance of sweat on your ear. One thing in mind before you chose this one, Amazon gives a free replacement for 7 days for this one after then it got damaged its your faith. Jbl or harman Couldn't involve for a best solution. Even Amazon could try to get disputed by returning it, but support.jbl can't give you a denial letter.",3.0 out of 5 stars

165, This a lovely over the ear headphones.Awesome sound. For those who use samsung galaxy s series go to sound settings turn on Dolby and select sound output to rock.Bingo!! Now listen to the music in this you will love it. For movies or social videos you can keep on other settings.Yes like other reviews your ear might pain if you use it for too long I mean for an hour or so. Take a break in between. Maroon color looks awesome with a shiny golden infinity logo. It's foldable flat so that it's easy for packing in bagpacks. Overall a great product for those who feel uncomfortable with in ear buds like me. Yes a small drawback ears become sweaty in summers after a while as it doesn't have a cotton cover on ear foam.(That you can buy separately if you want). Over all I loved it. Got it for 999. Bang for Buck!!!,4.0 out of 5 stars
166,Everything is good but can't be used for long session cause it starts to sweat inside the ear. Apart from that it's perfect but it's not for longer periods.

I had faced many issues with other wired headphones earlier, like one of the side used to stop working suddenly. But this one has never caused a single issue until now, and is working perfectly even after a year of heavy usage. I won't go into technical details, as obviously, there are much better options out there. But if you are looking for some budget headphones and are fine with wired ones, you can go for this.",4.0 out of 5 stars

270,"Please excuse the long review!!This is a review from someone who never used headphones.I assumed that it’s going to be absolutely silent once I put on the headphones with ANC on.It’s not absolutely silent, but it’s a lot better than direct noises from vehicles, horns and general noise outside.When we try to play videos on laptop or mobile speakers, if there is noise from outside, we can’t make out the video sound. That issue is resolved with this. You can always hear the video sounds even with considerable amount of drilling and other noises in the background.I never used headphones before. So I cannot compare them with anything or comment about the weight. However they are comfortable to wear. I never felt the urge to remove them. When I wore them for hours together, after removing them I felt a little tingling and numbness around the area the first day. But it’s probably because I never wore headphones.Then I also noticed that after long hours of wearing, my ears started to hurt on the inside. I decided to limit the usage however comfortable they feel.The first time I had some trouble connecting to laptop and mobile, but we can figure it out. It’s working seamlessly now and I know where and what to click if it doesn’t connect automatically.I didn’t like the ambient sound. It feels strange with that on. I turned it off. Also I deactivated auto motion detection. For someone like me, speak to chat is also not suitable. Sometimes while watching an anime, when you say something out of excitement, it pauses the video. Ha ha… Very well built. These are all personal preferences though.Additional observations:All these below points are without playing in the headphones.You can hear the voices from TV with them. Voices won’t be cancelled out.You can hear the person talking who is next to you.It doesn’t cancel out hand blender noise. You can constantly hear it.It doesn’t cancel the dogs barking from a distance. This is the most irritating thing.It cannot nullify drilling noises completely. It reduces the intensity.The day to day simple noises are almost nullified. This gives better call quality during teams calls.I was told my voice quality improved a lot when I switched from laptop mic to xm5 mic.With the drilling noise in the back, I tried to record my voice in a normal tone. The background noise is almost gone. However my voice itself sounded muffled. It wasn’t clear and a bit difficult to even make out the words.On the other hand, when I recorded it using iPhone, the voice was clear but there was background noise too.Overall the iPhone mic is the best. The audio sounds crystal clear when recorded on iPhone but of course background noise is heard.When you turn on some other audio in headphones, like music at 40% sound, most of the outside is gone including drilling, horns, people talking in proximity. That is wonderful. 😄I’m saying most because, drilling noise is quiet difficult to nullify.Overall I like them. I’m going to use them a lot but for limited durations at a time.Update after few weeks:Sometimes the connection to laptop is seamless. Sometimes it troubles a lot. Yesterday it never connected at all. I didn’t know what to do. It could be a problem from laptop too.Another things I noticed, when noise cancellation is on, and there is a certain amount of noise around you, it creates a pressure within the earcups. It is very evident if observed without music playing. This pressure is a bit less in ambient mode as this mode doesn’t cancel out everything. I realised that this is the reason why my ears hurt on the inside when I wear these. It could be probably because of the negative noise waves that are generated to cancel out the actual noise. The phenomenon is probably same for all active ANC devices. But xm5s are the first I’m trying.When ANC is off and say the headphones themselves are off and you are wearing them, then there is is continuous sound that is generated like wind howling. So these cannot be used like this.These devices cannot provide the natural peace we get when present in an actual place. I was hoping it’d be possible to some extent. But nope!",4.0 out of 5 stars
271,"The XM5s were in my wishlist for so long, and I was hyped on finally getting them. But people buying them in India should be wary about a few points:PROS:1. Excellent sound quality, once you tweak the EQ. Look up the ideal EQ settings online, should be easy to find. I tried the flat profile (which still sneaks some lower frequencies in though, be mindful).2. Call quality is surprisingly good. Works really well with Teams / Zoom as well.3. Noise cancellation is supreme. I have not tried out the Airpods Max / Bose QCxx series so cannot compare with those though.4. Sony Headphones Connect app makes it easy to setup and upgrade firmware (which you should do immediately after switching them on for the first time)5. Multi Device Connect works flawlessly. Its disabled in the app by default though.CONS:1. Ear pressure : Sometimes the headphones cause quite a bit of ear pressure. It eventually got better after a day, but check it out on your own.2. In the hot Delhi summers, wearing these without an AC in the vicinity can cause some serious amounts of sweat to build up. Not the fault of the headphones, our weather can be toasty :)3. People with spectacles can have varying amounts of comfort. I have thick acetate specs and I took a bit of time to make sure the headphones dont dig in too much.That being said, I'm happy with these headphones, would recommend.",4.0 out of 5 stars
272,"Things I liked:Extremely comfortable, I've worn it for 5+ hours on multiple days with no issues.Noise cancellation is superb.The audio quality is decent, but if you know how to adjust the EQ on the app, you can improve it a lot! I've adjusted the EQ and it now sounds perfect.Things I disliked:The entire device is a fingerprint magnet. If you're someone who regularly oils their hair, make sure you wash your hair properly before using it.The headphone is not waterproof. It has 8 mics on it, so take extra care to keep it away from all water sources.If you wear specs, the quality of noise cancellation decreases a bit.Things that were okay with this headphone:The headphones support LDAC audio codec, but you can only use this to the fullest if you're using Apple Music (set to lossless in settings). No other streaming services like Spotify or YouTube contain content of sufficient quality to enjoy LDAC quality. So unless you have lossless files, or Apple Music, there's no point in getting this headphone just for the LDAC codec.The fit is not super tight, or loose. It is very comfortable when you're sitting, walking or even running. But if you look down (while tying shoelaces, etc) you might feel like the headphone might fall off.It has touch controls on the right earpiece. It is convenient, but can also register unwanted touches.Overall:Amazing BT headphones, very satisfied with my purchase. Get it under twenty-five thousand if possible.",4.0 out of 5 stars
273,"These are the best headphones from Sony. Previously I used Sony headphones but they're entry-level headphones. I also used headphones from other brands like Sennheiser, One Audio and JBL but all of them are entry-level headphones. This is the first time I bought high-end headphones and I trust Sony. You can't go wrong with Sony as per my experience. Coming to the headphones, I already knew that these were best. However, I researched thoroughly on YouTube and read many articles for almost 3 months before buying these. I want to get the best value for the price. These headphones are costly and I don't want to go wrong with my purchase decision.Build quality: These are made of high-quality plastic and feel lightweight and comfortable to wear for longer durations. The only thing is, that the headband is thin and hurts a little on my head after wearing it for a few hours. Just move or adjust it a little and I'm good to go for another hour.Sound quality: It's Sony, no need to brag about sound quality. Sony is known for sound clarity. Every small musical instrument is heard in great detail. I can't forget my first experience of listening to music using these headphones. I'm blown away by the details and the clarity of sound.Battery life: It is mentioned 30 hours. Seems to be true. Headphones will easily last up to two days of mixed usage.Noise cancellation (N.C.): These headphones are my first experience with noise cancellation. When NC is turned on, it is silent. Zero noise. But after a few days, I realised that I could still hear voices from other people when they were shouting or talking loudly. It's good not to completely block all sound.Update on N.C.:I want to address one thing people who are saying that NC is not good. I think they feel like that because of the adaptive NC feature in the Sony headphones app. Due to this feature, the level of Noise cancelling is adjusted automatically according to the surroundings. I know it doesn't work 100% accurately every time. It works sort of 70 - 80 % accurately depending on the surroundings. That's why some people complain that NC is not completely silent or perfect. Some are complaining there is no option to disable the adaptive NC feature. It is available in the Sony headphones app after the latest update. We can also manually disable the adaptive NC of headphones using the app. I mentioned these details because some people may not be aware of these features available in the headphones app.Note: When NC is turned on, a sound pressure is created between ears and headphones. So there is a vacuum-like seal between ears and headphones and it blocks external sound. I'm not sure how NC works. This is the first time for me experienced noise cancellation. It was a shock and a surprise feeling when NC was on. My brother got scared due to this effect. I got used to it now. Check the Sony manual regarding the safety of NC. In the Sony Headphones Connect app, there is a safe listening setting. Please follow it and you don't need to worry about your ears getting damaged due to headphones. I have attached screenshots of the same. Please check.Final Verdict: I can say that these headphones are the best consumer headphones. Audiophile headphones are different that's why I mentioned them as the best consumer headphones. Most people who use them will love them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
274,"Overall product is good . If you are looking high bass then it's not there. You can connect two product simultaneously but it will run or you can say switch over which one is running currently. Battery backup is fine. Well I haven't tried in outside for call receiving or gone with headphone. In room I have tried for call receiving it's OK . In Heavy environment (full pack of noise) if you are receiving a call after putting noise reduction still you will receive noise some of. By look Headphone size looks very heavy but it's very light and comfort for long hours. My ears don't pain. But sweat after wearing for long period. Bag 🎒 design is unique.

Once I was talking just 10 cm in front of cooler andthe other person heard only mild whisper like noise but my voice was crisp and clear.Battery life is a LOT. More than a day of full use at least.Connectivity is super fast, as soon as you switch on it connects within 1-2 seconds on your paired devices.If you have sneaky neighbour or family member you can just turn on loud music or cooler to talk to your gf and she won't hear a thing🙂.Its better than iphone or other software based voice isolation/focus as its good beamforming array of 6 mic plus its private and hardware based so your call won't be processed in ""cloud"".Will update after few months regarding its durability.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I've been watching this product since launch and I'm happy that I finally got my hands on it.It was a gift for my birthday and I am happy about it.I will recommend this product especially if there is a great deal!after using it for a couple of days. I got to explore the features and the app.I love their safe sound feature. I work where I am constantly in meetings and calls and it's bad for my ears.

281,"Having used both the XM4 and XM5s now. Here is my review.-Sound Quality-It takes a few days for your ears to adjust to new source so i gave it a week for my ears to adjust.Treble has now more emphasis and detail with more midrange details and the Base is more active and crisp. Although the after adjusting it more to my taste in the EQ seting, I still think these headphones are a bit harsh on ears and cause Fatigue under long listening hours, Whereas the XM4s are really easy going. If you adjust your EQ well, I think the XM4's signature is better. It is Subjective so I would suggest you take a listen at Sony demo.-ANC-The very fact that the ANC is now automatic is an issue, What if it does not get your Environment right? I have yet to take these on a flight but I am very Skeptical about them. I prefer the manual control on XM4. Also not as drastic or in cases even same level NC compared to XM4s. (Beware of the Youtube reviews).-Price-The very Existence of the XM4 makes these a hard option to suggest. For Half the price you get almost the same or even better performance. If you can live with not having the latest and greatest, the XM4s are still a better option and easy recommendation.-Bonus-Or shall I say, not a bonus is that these don't fold. I thought it wont bother me but I was wrong. It is awkward to carry it around compared to the folding xm4. Kudos for packaging though.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Ok, where do I start.Let me tell you about my experience.1. Noise CancellingI was traveling to Thailand and i took these headphones with me for the flight and definitely that was the best decision i had made. At the airport I downloaded a series on Netflix to watch on the flight but I got time so, I started watching the series there and when I enable ANC on this headphones all the surrounding sounds were cut of immediately and that blew my mind, not only that I used this on the airline best experience.2. ComfortI used these headphones for about 7 hours continuously and seriously these headphones are very comfortable, although I was expecting this because of memory foam used on the earcaps.Pros:Noice cancellingSound QualityVery stylishVery ComfortableCons:No IP ratingNot foldable like xm4Not that good for gamingBut still if you decide to buy these then they are value for money.",5.0 out of 5 stars

285,"🔴The ANC (overall great but doesn't block all noise)It works fine but don't live in a dilemma (I did) that it will block all the noise, I can still hear my ceiling fan on full speed but at a extremely lower volume, my parents talking from few feet aparts is almost non audible but yeah I can hear them at a extremely low volume, the birds chirping from 10-20 feet apart is occassionally hearable too. Play any music while on ANC and then ALMOST every background noise will be blocked.🔴THE CREAKING SOUND WHILE MOVING HEAD in this is almost non noticable, (people say there isn't any creaking noise but there is very minor, it exists)🔴SOUND QUALITY is good BUT the default eq is the worst, you should try different eqs and make yourself one (I thought it would be hard but nope, I was done in 4 minutes) then it will, for me, sounds way better and actually worth paying 26k🔴 It's Comfortable BUT (for someone who doesn't do any sort of neck exercise and have an average head) it's till a bit heavy, I know 250 g for a headphone is very light weight but for me who switched from airpods to headphones, it feels heavy but the comfortable headband always puts me to sleep 😴. The headband is also quite thin, (took me solid 30 minutes to achieve a position where it doesn't hit the top of my head and still feel comfortable.)🔴AMBIENT MODE for an average person is actually great, nothing to complain about🔴Mics are also great, and extreme clear, do check the reviews🟢OVERALLSOUND QUALITY ⭐⭐⭐⭐ANC ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 1/2⭐Mic ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Highs ⭐⭐⭐⭐Lows ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Comfort ⭐⭐⭐⭐🚩🚩🚩Delivery (bought from APPARO RETAIL) ⭐⭐, they literally threw my headphones into a big oversized box WITHOUT ANY PROTECTION, it was just a bix box where my headphones where jumbling, like a small pencil in a big pencil box, no bubble wrap, no paper filling to have my headphones not dance while inside, nothing was given.

293,"Update:The ANC is great for blocking the sound of wind (not fan sound within room), bus engine sound, train trach changing sounds, voices from other people.I took a 10 hour train journey and 2hr bus journey with this item. OH MANN!! this product is exceptional. Go for this if u used to travel alot.Original Review:i was using a TWS prior to this. Main reasons for an upgrade are> it needs to be recharged everyday> It can only connected with single device. If i connect my device to the Office System for calls, then to attend the call from my phone is to take the earpiece off and attend.> Mic quality is not sufficient.> Too much noise to the recipient.I did my research on Sennheiser, Sony and Bose headphones.Reason why i choose Sony is, the ANC. Once my friend brought SONY WH-H910N and i had the experience on ANC. I was soo stunned. So i knew the Sony ""was"" the king of ANC.Also, i own a RT3 Home Theatre of Sony. which deliver boosted bass and good crisp mid tones.I am a fan of Sennheiser. But unfortunately, the ANC is not up to its competitors. Same thing goes for Bose. ANC was my prime objective to my next headphones.I knew the XM4 is a good Value for Money headset when compared to XM5. But i had some samples of both XM4 and XM5. Sound quality was somewhat similar. major upgrade is on the mic performance. So i opted for XM5.Also all my other requirements can be fulfilled by these products.BUT...I am not impressed with XM5 in terms of ANC. It is better than XM4. But its not worth 6000+ with the predecessor. Mic Quality is better too.Verdict:If you can get it with 22k, then consider this.otherwise, go for XM4 for 19,990/-",4.0 out of 5 stars
294,"Although it's a great product by Sony, but the software compatibility is not so promising at this point. What I look for is, either Sony should let the user decide the level of ANC or should develop a proper software mechanism to detect the motion of the person.In my personal use, I found out that, even when I was sitting on my couch, It was detecting that I was standing, & set the ANC level automatically accordingly. It's kinda irritating as it keeps changing your ANC level by itself in a while & we have no option to adjust it but to bare with it. I think at this price point, Sony should take it seriously. Hopefully, with a new software update, it can be rectified.Rest, the call quality, sound quality is top notch & there will be no issue to anyone for sure.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I tried the Bose QC45s and these definitely beat them.In terms of sound, these are a no brainier in the ANC category. They have the coloured Sony bass heavy profile by default but I’ve adjusted the eq from the app to make the frequency response much flatter. Now they sound pretty close to my studio headphones which I use for producing and mixing music. Soundstage is pretty wide and convincing.Battery life is great and it charges super quick.The Sony app integration is top notch. 6band eq lets you get the sound you want.Now here are the downfalls.They don’t fold like the earlier version, the case gets bigger. Still a pretty slick case but yeah, it’ll take up more real estate in your backpack.They are a fingerprint magnet. I couldn’t keep these clean for more than 10mins.The headband is comfortable but could’ve been slightly wider.That’s it.I bought these for leisure listening and making music on the go and they seemed to have checked all the boxes.

306,"Hello Fellow buyer's!!Many of you must have ended up being interested in this product after watching many reviews on the YouTube already, afterall below 25-30K isnts a small amount of money for a pair of Headphones right? So I will sum my experience about this pair in three major areas Comfort, ANC and Call quality and Sound quality.1. Comfort:These are very lightweight, people complain them for feeling cheap and plasticky thats obvious you dont get lightweight with metal constructions, having said that they provide enough coushioning you will ever need for long hours. But since they are not as flexible as their predecessors they have a bigger footpring which isnt very comfortable carrying always.2. Coming to ANC and Call quality:As many reviewers have already said, its amazing and Mind-blowing you will enjoy the ANC, I use in in Public Transport (Train) and when I have my volume level at 50-60% (recommend not to go beyond that for ear safety) you would barely even hear what the next person sitting to you is speaking unless you pay attention. Call quality is amazing outdoors and indoors it almost matches phone microphone reproduction when indoors but!! They struggle in windy situations so if you on the window seats try avoiding wind for calls.3. Sound quality:I have been using expensive earphones for quite a long time I have my audiophile 1more quad drivers, Sennheiser HD 202, Sennheiser Momentum wired earbuds, Oppo enco x and x2's so I believe I now have some understanding about how a good pair should sound, having said that The default Audio quality is decent also it varies which device you are connected, I wud suggest that you should use them with LDAC enabled all the time!! Its pretty decent nothing mind-blowing but it can be tweaked for amazing soundgazmic experience using app, u can enjoy A.R. Rehman tracks such as Dil Se and experience a variety of instruments audible suddenly.I woud not compare it with bose, Sennheiser Momentum 4, Airpod max, i believe sound is subjective and everyone has to adjust accordingly and be satisfied with their purchase after they have made an investment and not be disappointed due to subjective opinions other have.Concluding this very long review, these are a value for Money pair of Headphones, I got them at a good discount and hence I went with xm5s rather than xm4s. If you want custom eq screenshot and settings I use for tweaking my Xm5s do let me know in reply section.Happy Buying you have made a good decision 🙂",5.0 out of 5 stars
307,"First, let me rant about Amazon. I bought 'two' (both colors) of these headphones on the 21st of September (the launch date), as a Pre-order. According to Amazon, I was the first order (basically the 1st customer) to order XM5 on their site in India.I received my headphone on the 18th of October (nearly a month later, and a week after launch) — others that ordered on the 14th Oct were getting them on the same day or the next day (on my PIN code), but Amazon couldn't get them delivered to the very first customer. (what's the point of pre-order — I decided to escalate the issue on the 15th of Oct when others were writing reviews. This escalated through Amazon's hierarchy. And these pathetic jokers have just lied to me on the phone and by email.REVIEW Starts here — after 10 days of heavy use!I have become a bit of an ANC headphone collector, and I have SONY XM2, XM3, XM4, and XM5 | Bose QC 35 II, NC700, and QC 45. (for most I have reviewed here on amazon on their product page)Before XM5, my daily driver was always Bose NC700. Before NC700, my daily driver was QC 35 II.The primary reason is the multi-point connections and call quality — before XM4, Sony didn't have a multi-point connection. And the call quality wasn't very good. So, Bose would be my headphone of choice for 8+hrs a day every day. Now, my daily driver is XM5.The call quality on the XM5 is phenomenal. Beyond expectations. The improvements to ANC have been very infinitesimal since XM3, (to XM4 to XM5). The XM5's auto-ANC (which can't be turned off) was problematic, with the ANC turning off when you move your head. The latest firmware update fixes this — and makes this issue less frequent (almost nonexistent).I have always enjoyed the sound quality on SONY, but with XM5, you can definitely notice a change (if you're used to XM3, and XM4 sound signatures). The EQ-ing helps, only partially. The bass is no longer as impactful as it is in XM3.Oh did I mention the call quality is amazing? I take work calls/meetings from coffee shops. No problemo!Battery, I had to charge this headphone only once. In total, I have used 60 hrs, in the last 10 days. (2 headphones fully!). And 30hrs is exactly as expected (maybe 2hrs here and there).I also feel the best of the ANC is Bose QC 45 (the latest one). But the problem is the call quality sucks big time. The previous model, QC 35 II has better microphones for calls compared to the QC 45.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Bass hasgot the right amount of punch and doesn't over power the vocals and instruments.I tried playing with the eq settings but kept switching it off as the music really didn't need any more magic as sony on its default setting has represented the music really well.The noise cancelation and ambient noise features are also not over powering and make you feel safe when you wear them.Overall sony has done a fab job and I am looking forward to what's next in their flagship headphones.The price is absolutely justified once you experience these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Hands down, one of the best call quality in any headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars

320,"Purchased a unit from `Apario Retail`, The brand new box had dirt marks, slightly crushed from side, the headphone bag and so the headphone had small dust. Constantly felt etching over ears, i slightly pushed the ear cushion to find few hair follicles. The microphone also sounded wobbled, I recorded multiple samples. I wonder if these are refurbished/used units. Ordered a replacement, the microphone recorded crystal clear, no etching either.With regards to sony, I've tried AirPod 2, AirPod 2 Pro. AirPod 3, AirPod Max. Durability of airpods is really questionable, I and my friends own couple of airpods, they stop working randomly (some times pairing issue, charging issue, misbalanced charge, muffled microphone, sudden sharp drop in battery etc) after warranty period of 1 year, and they are not at all serviceable by Apple. If you take them to Apple, Apple will ask you to buy a new piece instead. I wonder if Apple really trusts them with Quality, they don't have trade-in program for AirPods for a reason. :)AirPod 2 and AirPod 3 are just same (No ANC either) for all practical reasons, AirPod 2 Pro and AirPod Max comes with ANC, AirPod 2 Pro is good but comes with INR 27,000 price tag. But these Sony's are more comparable to AirPod Max, the ANC is equal, if not better than AirPod Max. The sound is more bassy though, AirPod Max is slightly more comfortable for big ears, otherwise overall Sony is much better than AirPod Max. AirPod Max is also x2.4 times pricy than these (Whooping INR 60k). Sony's are known to last for years. The microphone also sounded equally good or equally bad on voice memo on iPhone.Also have tried Bose QC 35 II, QC 700, ANC is not comparable to Sony's, the sound signature is also not comparable, but QCs are much more soft and comfortable for big ears. QCs I believe come with 4 microphone in total, Sony's come with 8.The 360 degree audio on Sony's is cross-selling trick, Altough really good tech, you won't find lot of content/meaningful apps supporting Sony's 360 degree audio. I haven't tried spatial audio on AirPod Max.Verdict: These are really must have if you can't work in noisy environment. Very good at almostly completely supressing ambient noise, lowers the intensity of sharp, transient, loud noise to good extent.",3.0 out of 5 stars
321,The sound is amazing no doubts and its Sony. But ANC is next level. I have used XM4 earlier but XM5 has noticeable difference. Trust me. YouTube reviews say that no major difference but I honestly felt it upgradation in ANC. Go for it and use it for next 4 to 5 years easily.,5.0 out of 5 stars

323,Great ANC and amazing sound quality. Customisable sound as per requirement and taste.,5.0 out of 5 stars
324,I have pre-ordered this on 24th September and got it delivered on 17th October. That's 9 days after release whereas amazon is giving one-day delivery from 13th. So I got it even late than normal orders. And the special pre-order price they have mentioned is also a scam. The price is the same even after release. Inital connection to my pixel 6 phone was easy. I have later updated head phones to latest version. But then I had issue pairing my m1 macbook. I was unable to enter pairing mode. Pressing power button for 5 sec is switching off the headphone instead of pairing it. After spending lot of time I was able to pair macbook through sony's android app by enabling pairing mode from app using an option to connect to two bluetooth devices at same time and then clicking add device. The headphones have good ANC and mic quality through there are some caveats. The apps supporting sony's 360 reality audio are nugs.net and a sony's app containing sample audio's both of which are not helpful for everyday listening. So practically not really much use with 360 reality audio. The amazon music is said to support 360 reality audio but I wasn't able to tell any difference. The services such as tidal that support hi-fi and 360 reality audio are not available in India. My pixel 6 and xm5 both said to support ldac but I wasn't able to use ldac. Not sure its my pixel 6 or xm5's fault. So I am stuck with AAC in both my phone and laptop. The sound quality isn't bad except when I start using the mic. This is the issue with every bluetooth headphone since they don't have enough bandwidth to support input and output. When using the mic in my m1 macbook I saw it switching to HEP from A2DP and using mSBC instead of AAC codec. The headphones also support wired connection which is good so you get better quality but xm5 is not supporting mic with wired connection. So if you want mic then you suffer audio quality. I have bigger ear than normal person and it's not really comfortable for me. I get ear pain when wearing. The headphone manufacturing quality is not good when compared to the price. See the attached pic. The case is advertised as collapsible but you can collapse only a bit because the slot for wires obstructs collapsing.,3.0 out of 5 stars

332,Wonderful product by sony. My son loved it.,5.0 out of 5 stars
333,"I bought this primarily for use in the home office because my kid gets noisy around the house. This does its job well enough. The auto optimizer is great and you can hear it adapting and the ANC getting stronger when the construction machines outside my house start operating. I had the version 1 of this series (MDR-1000XM or XM1) and the ANC is noticeably better.Comfort: I wear glasses and these have the same problem as the XM1s had and they cause the specs to dig into my head. This gets uncomfortable after a while. I tried the Bose QC 35 series and they are much more comfortable with glasses. But their ANC is not as strong as the sony's.Bluetooth connectivity: They work flawlessly with a single connection and the range is also great. I can walk around the whole house without the signal dropping. The problem is in multi device connectivity. When connected to two devices, it's not so great at switching to the correct host. Like say it's connected to my laptop and phone and I play music on my phone. It will stay connected to the laptop even though nothing is playing on it. But when a phone call comes, it will switch over to the phone. So the switching seems to be profile dependent. My previous Bose soundsport's were better at such decisions.Sound quality (music): I can say there's a small degradation in sound quality since XM1. While the XM1 had great sound across most frequencies, these (XM5s) are more bass heavy and light on mids and trebles. I haven't played with the EQ enough yet so maybe this is fixable.Sound quality (calls): Much improved microphones as compared to XM1s. I no longer have to switch to the laptop's mic for the meetings.All in all, I don't regret my purchase. These do their ANC job perfectly and that's mostly what mattered to me. I'll probably buy another headphones for music.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Now I realise people were just nitpicking.Sony is arguably the best ANC head/earphone manufacturer around. The xm5s are an absolutely complete package. People saying the case is too big have tiny bags and unrealistic expectations.Fit obviously depends on your head/ear shape & size. Fits my head perfectly and covers my ears completely. Only wish would be that they gave us a spare set of headphone cushions. I know these will wear out soon.Noise cancelling is immense, ambient mode is brilliant. Honestly blown away by how good these are.",5.0 out of 5 stars
341,"Sony WH-1000XM5 is an awesome product in this category with great ANC, sound quality and extreme comfort wearing them.Looks are very premium, even to the touch of materials and cushion. Very lightweight given the size and quite comfortable to wear for longer period of time.The carry bag comes with a USB C cable and a 3.5 audio jack.ANC is very superior in isolating even in a crowded environment, even putting it on without any playback is really good. If you have used a premium TWS from pixel or airpods, it's a step-up even from the great ANC provided on these TWS.Ambient mode (transparent mode) is great at making the voices around sound clearer. The feature for automatically adjusting ambient mode is pretty convenient (available on the app), it automatically switches to ambient mode when walking or running based on the location. You can also adjust how much ambient noise should be let through (even suppress background noise and allow only voice frequencies through which is very good.Sound quality is really good, but it's very subjective, I guess. For me, it's been really great, you can check out the video linked below to get a full picture of it.Some noteworthy features:Speak-to-chat (enable on the app) - switches to ambient mode from ANC when u starts speaking, might be an inconvenience if you're someone who sings along but it's a huge convenience otherwise.Multi-point connect - works pretty much like on pixel buds pro or other TWS with support for it, but the audio switch is much quicker.5-band EQ is available with 3 custom setup option.watch this for a good review and comparison with other products around this range https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlQaZDw25Uo&t=270s",5.0 out of 5 stars

A lot of reviews and videos are already out there on social media for its features, will not comment on those things.•Sound quality out of the box (EQ) isn’t something wow on apple music or spotify premium!!•The EQ customisation comes to rescue and improves sound staging drastically, m using a Custom EQ which I have attached in my review, it gives better sound staging. (For those like airpods pro user or who are finding bass too muffled can try this EQ, hope that will help)•Silver colour isn’t attracting visible smudges as much as the black ones.•Connectivity and touch functions are butter smooth.•Call clarity with zooms or Microsoft teams is just amazing.•Siri responses to input commands by long pressing right earcup. (However doesn’t automatically reads notifications or caller names like in airpods pro/Max)•USB charging cable is too small.Will not recommend to upgrade if you are already using Apple music with Airpods pro/Max as the spatial audio is best utilised there.

345,"Have been using an excellent pair of ANC earphones. So when I first used these out of the box, I wasn't impressed with the ANC (unlike the rest of the world).You start using the ANC and set the custom equalizer (screenshot attached), these really start to shine. They'll take a day/two to actually start showing the magic. Here's everything to love about these:- Unboxing experience is great (Tip: Before pressing the on/off button on the headphones for the first time, put them on and then press the button. The VA will guide you on the further steps)- The Noise Cancelling (Bummer), The sound (Play the 360 Spatial Audio video on YT)- Volume at 60% should be enough for most people to enjoy the music.- Extremely comfortable to wear for long durations and these charge really fast.- The Bluetooth range is good enough to roam around a duplex without worrying about fades.- The app gives enough customizability freedom. The ""Safe Hearing"" feature is a ++- The looks people will give you while using these.What's not so good:- Sony should hire a UI/UX engineer to rebuild the app interface. In terms of look and feel if the headphones are a 10, the app is a 2. Does the job but not so pleasant to look at.- The black color is a fingerprint magnet. It still looks dope thou.Worth the purchase!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Saves a lot of switching between phone and laptop to attend calls on both of them as and when needed.Noise cancellation works absolutely perfect for me.

I mean these are just minor issues. It's not a bug deal, but still I would like to address it. There is a feature called DSEE EXTREME which upscales low quality sound. But whenever we turn that on and control the volume by touching the up and down touch sensors then you can hear that the audio starts to stutter and starts to Crack which a bit annoying. If it is off, then no issues. Another thing is that, I don't know how many have experienced it. Sometimes my crown starts to pain. But after sometime it will go away and I'll get comfortable.

349,"I have been using Sennheiser HD 4.40 BT for the last 5 years. The headphones sounds good, but they are uncomfortable to wear for long hours. That made me look for a new headphone. I got 1000XM5 at a discounted price of ₹21500 using SBI credit card. Received both the aux cable & usb cable in the bag. These are very lightweight & can be worn for longer periods without any ear pain or discomfort. ANC is good, it does not create too much pressure on ears. Reason why I’m saying it because I use airpods pro on a daily basis & it creates lot of pressure on ears. So having experienced both, I would say ANC is a bit better on airpods pro, but with more pressure on ears. The sound quality of XM5 is amazing, it’s bass heavy. Watching movies or tv shows using these is just incredible. Last but not the least, it gives you 30 hours of battery backup (with ANC on) on a single charge & gives 3 hours of backup with just 3 mins of charge.

357,"Given the price of the product, it has big flaws that sony won't address in software updates.1. The auto ANC will keep on changing noice cancellation levels depending on surrounding. Hence, if you have a fan rotating or people talking nearby, you can feel the anc lagging and noice creeps in periodically. Sony won't give a software update to set a fix level for ANC.2. The surround sound is a gimmicky feature. Good luck finding apps/websites that support it. Sony should partner with at least a few major movie/song streaming websites to support surround sound experience. Instead, they give free trials to some apps that have very poor selection of songs.3. The sound quality out of the box is not good for what you pay. You need to play around with the equalizer. You can feel lack of clarity which was present in xm3 amd xm4.4. A couple of times, it was playing songs when headphones were not worn and pauses them when you wear them. This was some wierd bug that happens with it doing on ear detection. This happens when you switch between multiple devices and have multi-device connect on.5. The headphones don't give a tight enough fit on head. Hence, they will slip when lying down or walking fast.6. Ambient mode has lots of hissing noise creeping in.7. In teams call on windows, it makes a lot of hissing sound even when everyone is on mute.8. If you play some song, take them off and put them in case, they will play the song inside the case because the provided case has padding which it thinks is a ear and plays the music. Because of this reason, battery will also drain a lot.9. The swivel on two earcups have a plastic feel and do make creeky sounds often.10. if you use provided wire (generally when battery is low), mic does not work on it. microphone works only in wireless mode only.11. the type c cable provided can be increased in lenght slightly more so that it is useful in some scenario.

It does suppress the background noise.7) Dual pairing device.Cons:1) The product is completely made of plastic so don't know the life durability.2) The control buttons are bit harder.3) In dual pairing... I don't know for what reason if the device is connected with my mobile.... It is not getting connected with my laptop until I disconnect it from my mobile.... Once it is connected with my laptop I'll connect it back with my phone. (Not sure if everybody is Facing this issue)4) Normally the pause button works on youtube...

390,"I recently purchased the Zebronics Headphones from Amazon, and I must say, they are a delightful surprise, especially considering their budget-friendly price. These headphones have impressed me with their overall performance and features.First and foremost, the sound quality is surprisingly good for headphones in this price range. The audio is clear and well-balanced, with decent bass that adds depth to music and enhances the overall listening experience. Whether I'm enjoying my favorite tracks, watching movies, or even gaming, the Zebronics headphones deliver satisfactory sound without any distortion.Comfort is another strong suit of these headphones. The adjustable headband and soft cushioned ear cups provide a snug fit and can be worn comfortably for extended periods without causing discomfort or fatigue. The design is also lightweight, making them easy to carry around, which is perfect for my on-the-go lifestyle.I also appreciate the built-in microphone, which allows me to take calls hands-free while using the headphones. The call quality is clear, and I haven't encountered any issues with voice clarity during phone conversations.The headphones' build quality is decent, considering their affordable price point. Although they are mostly made of plastic, they don't feel flimsy or fragile. However, I would advise handling them with care to ensure their longevity.One minor drawback I noticed is the absence of active noise cancellation, which is expected at this price. While they do offer some passive noise isolation, it may not completely block out loud external noises. Nevertheless, it's not a deal-breaker for me, given the headphones' overall performance and affordability.In terms of connectivity, these headphones offer versatility with both wired and wireless options. I can use the included AUX cable to connect to various devices, and the Bluetooth connectivity works seamlessly with my smartphone and laptop.In conclusion, the Zebronics Headphones are an excellent choice for budget-conscious consumers looking for a decent audio experience. Their sound quality, comfort, and versatile connectivity options make them a reliable companion for music enthusiasts and casual users alike. While they may lack some advanced features found in higher-end models, these headphones offer great value for money and have pleasantly surprised me with their performance.",4.0 out of 5 stars
391,"I recently purchased the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones, and while they offer decent sound quality and a comfortable fit, there are some concerns regarding their durability.Let's start with the positives. The earphones provide a snug fit, ensuring comfort even during long listening sessions. The 10mm drivers deliver satisfactory sound performance, allowing you to enjoy your favorite music and audio with clarity. The passive noise cancellation feature is an added bonus, as it helps immerse you in your audio experience by reducing external noise distractions.Connecting the earphones to your device is a straightforward process. Simply plug in the 3.5mm audio jack, and within a few seconds, the earphones sync with your phone or tablet, ready to deliver audio.On the downside, the build quality of the earphone cable raises concerns. Some users have reported that the wires are not as sturdy as expected, making them susceptible to damage and tangling. This weakness in the wire construction may impact the longevity of the earphones, requiring extra care and attention during use and storage.The ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones come in a sleek design and are available in multiple color options, including Black, Blue, Green, Red, and White, allowing you to choose the one that suits your style.In terms of technical specifications, the earphones have an impedance of 16 Ω and a frequency response range of 20Hz-20kHz. The 1.2-meter cable length provides adequate flexibility for comfortable usage.It's important to note that these earphones come with a 6-month warranty, which provides some assurance in case of any manufacturing defects or malfunctions within the specified period.In conclusion, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones offer decent sound quality and a comfortable fit, making them suitable for everyday use. However, the durability concerns surrounding the wire strength are worth considering. If you prioritize longevity and robustness in your earphone choice, you may want to explore other options. Nevertheless, if you handle them with care, these earphones can provide an enjoyable audio experience at an affordable price point.",4.0 out of 5 stars

394,"It's been about 3 months, since I am using this earphone and trust me these will meet upto your expectations. Whether it's about sound quality, bass or design and weight of course.I too have boat's neckband(with prize 8-10 times more than its) and using both for long time.The sound has a little variation in terms of bass and quality of course(what else we can expect in this price 😁₹180) but good for daily use.The only negative side I will point out is about the quality of the product. The wire quality is not upto the mark (3/5), you have to handle it carefully and the earbuds are made of plastic material.Also the the button in the microphone is not at all useful, sometimes it works only to stop ongoing songs but you can't increase or decrease the volume.Overall I'll give it 4✨under the price I bought.An important suggestion:-If you find this product under the range of ₹200.And dont want to go for some high rate earhones, just go for it. It would be a good product to you. Otherwise, you can check out for some other earphones under 500.Some of them are boat or MI earphones and boult audio bass earphones. 👍Hope this will be helpful for you guys.🙂",4.0 out of 5 stars

529,The sound is really amazing and the quality of the headphones is also great. Comes with Aux cable as well. Very easy to connect and use. Don't pay more than 1000/- for it. One problem no one talks about is the popping sound very time it connects as it goes into power saving mode in 1 second if no music. The popping sound is very irritating. Other issue is Amazon delivery was very slow and they reduced the price by 200/- rupees afterwards. Total rip off by Amazon. This is now they earn money.,4.0 out of 5 stars

549,"I had high expectations for this gadget. But the sound was a disappointment.I found boat rockers 400 much better (and it's cheaper too).This one costs more, but the sound is so not up to the mark.

555,"I am writing this review after using this headphone for more than a month.ABOUT AMAZON DELIVERYFirst I would like to thank Amazon for delivering it before time. I live at Shimla. It is rainy season here. It rains cats-and-dogs here that too non-stop for days and weeks altogether without any respite in between. But, Amazon delivered the headphone without fail, and that too before time.ABOUT THE HEADPHONEIt is a great but at this price.I am a teacher.I use this headphone exclusively for online teaching.So, I needed a Bluetooth headphone which should take shorter duration to charge, but should give longer battery time.It takes roughly around 2 hours and 30 minutes to charge fully.And, after the full charge it gives me anywhere between 20 hours to 22 hours of runtime.The earcups completely covers my ears. This prevents external noises from interfering.The sound transmission and reception quality is exceptionally very good.My students can hear me loud and clear. I also can hear them loud and clear.LOOKS CUTEThe headphone is very cute. The colour combination is catchy/eye Turner.WILL I BUY AGAIN?Of course, I will.Being an online teacher, I do need backup devices.WILL I RECOMMEND TO OTHERS?I surely will recommend this headphone to my students and friends.This headphone is also good for watching YouTube videos and films, listening to music, and for telephonic talks.",5.0 out of 5 stars

559,"I recently purchased these headphones and was impressed by their excellent noise cancellation and stylish design. The noise cancellation feature effectively blocked out ambient sounds, allowing me to immerse myself in my music without any disturbances. The sleek and modern appearance of the headphones is also a plus.However, I did find the audio quality to be just average. While the sound was clear and balanced, it lacked the depth and richness that I was hoping for. Despite this drawback, the headphones still managed to deliver an enjoyable listening experience, especially when paired with genres that don't heavily rely on intricate audio details. Overall, if you prioritize noise cancellation and aesthetics, these headphones are worth considering, though audiophiles might want to explore other options for superior sound quality.",3.0 out of 5 stars

603,"The only thing good with this product is the sound quality from the earpods. Contrary to how it has been described it DOES NOT charge fast and it DOES NOT run for 35 hours continuously, even after charging for 10 hours straight, YES I've tried even that. And most of the times the battery of one of the earpods runs out first and faster than the other one, it's not fixed which one, sometimes it's left one other times the right one. And then when you try to charge both pods, that one whose battery ran out faster does not get charged easily, so many times I take it out and then plug it in again and again in hopes that it would start charging but it doesn't. So you are left with 100% battery in one pod and just 10% in the other one. And as I said it can't be fixed easily or quickly because of the charging issue. And if you're anything like me, no one likes to listen to music in just one ear🙄.",1.0 out of 5 stars

643,Right now I'm using this earbuds for around 20 days and the sound is very satisfactory. The bass and treble is quite clear and I think the sound quality is really good for the price. But there's only one single flaw in this device which is the latency. While gaming I almost hear sounds after like 55ms which is apparently equivalent to 1 second almost. The packaging says they provide a latency of 40 ms but it's not even close to 40. Hence the earbuds is a big no no for multiplayer games where sound is a key factor. Overall the conclusion is phantom 700 is good for music and casual gaming.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Look for earbuds with high-quality drivers and possibly support for advanced audio codecs like AAC and aptX for improved wireless audio quality.Comfort and Fit: Comfortable earbuds are essential, especially if you plan to use them for extended periods. Look for models that come with different ear tip sizes or ear wings to ensure a secure and snug fit for your ears.Battery Life: Long battery life is crucial for uninterrupted listening. Look for earbuds that offer several hours of playback on a single charge, and a case that provides extra charges on the go.Connectivity: For wireless earbuds, consider the Bluetooth version and its range. Bluetooth 5.2 is preferable for better connectivity and stability.",4.0 out of 5 stars

679,"After almost 3 weeks of usage, it feels value for money. Battery backup is fine for my usage. Sound quality is also very good at this price range. App support and Noise Cancellation mode is very much appreciated. One thing to keep in mind is that the case and buds itself felt very premium when I bought it. But both will get scratched very easily. We have to be extra careful while handling it. But to be fair we cannot expect much more in this price range. I'm happy with the product as of now. Will update if anything goes wrong.UPDATE:I faced some issue regarding the spontaneous activation of google assistant and followed by a shutdown of my earbuds. Don't know what caused the issue. I kept my buds aside and not used it for few weeks and the issue is now solved. Meanwhile, I raised request for replacement under warranty, and they responded to the mails I have sent. And pickup was scheduled. But no one contacted me for pickup. So now I am using the same buds which I received for the first time. Also app is not detecting that my earbuds are connected, most of the time. Even though I'm listening music through the buds. Not sure whether it's my phone issue or buds issue.",4.0 out of 5 stars
680,"""I recently got the JBL C100SI earphones, and I must say, they have a decent build quality that feels sturdy and durable. What impressed me the most is their excellent instrumental separation, which brings out the details in my music and makes every note shine. The bass is also good, adding a satisfying thump to my favorite tracks.However, one minor downside I noticed is that the audio volume seems a bit lower compared to some other earphones I've used in the past. It's not a deal-breaker, but it's something to consider if you like to crank up the volume.Overall, the JBL C100SI earphones offer a well-rounded audio experience with their great instrumental separation and satisfying bass. If you don't mind slightly lower audio levels, they're a solid choice for music lovers.""",4.0 out of 5 stars

If you are heavy bass lover than it is slightly lower than heavy. I love it because I dont like very heavy bass.

Whether you're listening to music, podcasts, or watching videos, the sound quality is truly commendable.

890,"You can get these headphones for as low as 8500/-, which seems like a steal compared to the regular price of 10,000/- plus. You can also go for the refurbished version, which will cost even less, somewhere about 7500/-.Now, the question is, is it worth the price? I have been extensively using it for the last few days, and let me share my experience.First of all, the audio quality and bass: As extra bass in the name, This headphone is a bass-heavy one. But it is probably the weakest thing about it. The word I would use is ‘inconsistent.’ In some songs, it is perfect; for others, it is outright horrible. After reducing the clear bass slider to negatives, you will have a consistent audio experience, but then it is no longer a bass headphone. So, if you like bass, and thinking about buying it, then… don’t. Add some more money and buy Skullcandy Crusher EVO, which comes at around 14,000/-.Apart from the bass, the audio quality is decent. The soundstage is not that wide. Even if you put the clear bass slider at minus ten, the trace of it is always there, which keeps the audio on the warmer side, which can be a good thing or bad, depending on your taste.Now, I have to mention here that after paying north of 8,000/- for a pair of headphones, you will feel like you are not getting something valuable in return. For example, when you upgrade your earphones from 500/- cheap ones to 2000/- ones, you feel the bump in quality. For me, it is worth paying an extra 1,000/- or 2000/- to buy some popular neckbands or IEMs (KZ ZSN Pro X, for example). You immediately see the return you are getting and feel glad you made a good purchase. But the XB910N will not give you that pleasure of purchase. You will most likely feel buyer’s remorse. Because, to be honest, these don’t sound much different than the 2000/- ones. The minute difference in quality between these (if you feel there are any) will not justify the significant price bump of 6,000/- plus. The sound quality is not bad by any stretch of the imagination. But it just doesn’t justify the price.Battery- The battery is excellent—no need to worry about it. 20+ hours of runtime with a single charge is more than enough.Bluetooth connectivity- It is decent. By the way, it has a multipoint connectivity feature. Which means you can connect two devices at the same time. I will highly recommend you look for this feature when you buy headphones. Having said that, the multipoint feature in these headphones is again inconsistent. I have paired it with my phone and pc, and it often forgets to switch between them. The volume of one of the devices goes to 100 percent randomly when you switch from one to another—basically, it is buggy. I don’t know whether my devices are the problem or the headphones, but I must mention the random glitches I have experienced. Also, there are random stutters in the audio, which, again, I don’t know whether they are due to the Bluetooth connection or my devices. Apart from the unexpected glitches and stutters, this headphone has no significant issues.Comfort- Comfort is probably the only thing I like about this headphone. You can wear it for a long time and won’t feel ear fatigue or pain of any kind. If you wear it in a non-AC environment, it will undoubtedly warm your ears but not to the extent that it will become unbearable. Full marks for comfort. One point I would like to add, headphones are recommended by doctors over earphones as far as ear health is concerned. So, if you wear some audio device for a long time to work or study, it is always advisable to choose headphones over earphones (of course, keeping the audio level low).ANC- Active noise cancellation is way below average, almost gimmicky. Anything below SONY wh-1000xm3 /xm4/ xm5 is not enough regarding ANC. You can’t just slightly reduce the fan noise and claim to have ANC. No, that is just worthless. So, if you are buying it for its ANC feature, let me tell you, only a handful of premium headphones give you an actual ANC experience, and you have to pay a significant amount of money to buy them. One thing I can recommend is to check out the refurbished SONY wh-1000xm4 headphones. They go as low as 14,000/- and you can try them. But safely skip this headphone if you are considering it for its ANC.Final Verdict- Who should buy these headphones? In an ideal world, no one. This headphone is a half-hearted attempt to give some premium-like features at an ‘affordable’ price. But the price is not affordable enough to appreciate the attempt. If you want premium features that actually work? Just go for xm4s. Pay the extra money and commit to using those excellent pairs of headphones long-term. If you want value for money, stick to the 2000/- budget, which gives the best value for money earphones.",3.0 out of 5 stars
891,"Quality :- headphones are well built and a thing of beauty for sure though i doubt the band's sturdyness a little bit in long run...Fit :- As a one who wear glasses the fit in really natural and clamping force is not much. The earmuffs are reallyyyyyyyy soft and premium but yea for a duration of more then 2 hours they'll start to feel uncomfy and you might need to give your ears some rest...Portability :- Best part is the sturdy hard case you can just throw your headphones in the case and need not to worry about them.. The case material is really good and looks hella classy...Battery life :- On a single charge on medium to heavy usage they delivers solid battery backup even when anc on... Though i not let the battery completely die on me and frequently charge them if they get below 30%SOUND :- Ok so if you are not much of a basshead (which we all are at some point) even then you can buy these headphones cause yeah you get the sony's custom app for Equalizing the sound to your preference..the highs and mids are too good...good instrumental sepration. Though the only thing that i found bit odd is the sound source always feel really close and does not resonate much (but surely not a dealbreaker)Bass as u expect is really good BUT it's more on a rumbling side rather then thumping (depends on personal choice) but the bass is exceptionally good..CONS:-1. The sounds quality changes a bit when switched to ANC specially the bass boosts up which sometimes sounds unnatural when switching to anc in midst of a song2. I've never used an anc headphone so maybe its a personal thing but when the ANC is turned on and if there's a significant BG noises then the headphones starts to vibrate (like bass rumble) which i found odd. Though resetting it fixed the issue but it do happens a lot.3. Touch controls sometimes (rarely)happens to be inaccurate, specially covering the earcup to switch to ambient noise feature.4.I personally don't like the looks of the headphone when wearing them they dont look much discreet (compare with 1000xm4 you'll understand what i mean)VERDICT :- I bought these for 13,000 but if they happens to cost more then that just go for the 1000xm4",5.0 out of 5 stars
892," I've been using this headset continuously for a month now, and it happens to be my first experience with premium headphones. Therefore, I'm preparing to share an honest review detailing both the positive and negative aspects I've encountered during my usagePositives:1)Exceptional sound quality.2)Unparalleled active noise cancellation; completely shields external sounds even in the midst of heavy traffic when used, such as during a cab ride.3)Extraordinarily comfortable.4)Bluetooth connectivity boasts a commendable range.5)In-app sound customization offers the ability to tailor audio to personal preferences, such as adjusting bass and vocals.6)Outstanding touchpad functionality with integrated voice assistant, track control, and playback management.7)Comes with a notably excellent carrying case.8)A harmonious blend of lightweight design and sturdiness, exuding a premium feel.9)Impressively prolonged battery life coupled with rapid recharging.Negatives:1)Ambient mode falls short of expectations.2)Phone call quality is subpar both with and without using an auxiliary connection, leading to unclear communication on the recipient's end.3)Limited wearability for extended periods due to excessive heat buildup within the cushions, necessitating removal every 15-20 minutes.4)Ill-suited for gym sessions as it induces significant perspiration.5)Not ideal for music production, particularly for electric guitar experimentation, with acoustic tones fairing better in comparison.As of now, this encapsulates my ongoing journey with the headphones. I'll continue to enhance my review as I come across any fresh insights. Wishing you wonderful moments ahead, and thank you for your time.",4.0 out of 5 stars

894,Honestly the product is great overall good battery ... Easily over 5 days usage during office hours ... Good sound quality... Amazing ANC for price but within a year the cushion leather tore and worst part is the cushions are not under warranty so a note if you purchase this.,4.0 out of 5 stars
895,"I got this after using Sony MDR-XB950BT for 6 years. That was a beast in terms of sound experience. Sadly it cracked and i couldnt get it into one piece.This is an excellent headphone for the price.The NC is spotty but it is good enough for my usage.The audio quality is crystal.The Bass is not consistent, with some songs sounding better than the others. But when it works it is good.Battery is pretty good with more than 20 hours of usage per charge.BT multipoint connectivity is reliable and stable.It is comfortable on the ears. I was able to use it for ~1.5 hours without fatigue or pain.It looks decent as well.I love to use the 3.5 jack option as I dont use BT all the time.The touch navigation needed some learning, but once you get used to it it is a breeze too.Overall happy with the purchase, but the audio quality is not as good my 6 year old MDR-XB950BT.",5.0 out of 5 stars

898,"I've been using Sony earphones (multiple models) for over last 14 years and none of it had let me down on the sound quality. Clarity, bass, overall quality and comfort are always good for every Sony earphones I've used so far, so thought to try it's over the ear Headphones this time and many reasearch suggests that earphones are not good for health.So as per my budget I decided to go for 910N, packing, first look, finishing and quality is no doubt very good. Sound depth, clarity, deep bass is awesome. But before buying it I checked many reviews and videos and many people talked about the comfort and said that you won't feel wearing it so comfortable that you can use it for hours and hours but frankly after continuous use of 45-50 mins I started feeling too tight on the head so generally have to adjust a lil bit or I just swap left to right otherwise it started feeling sticky around the ears that's the ONLY downside I felt for it or probably it may because I'm using over the ears for the first time.Battery backup is awesome, I generally use it for watching movies and for music and it lasts for atleast 2-3 weeks on general use.I also tried it for calls but feedback from other side was not that good about the mic quality so stopped using it. But call mic/ call quality over apps like Microsoft Teams and other such apps is very good that has their own sound quality/ noise suppression features inbuilt otherwise you'll get complaint about very low voice from the mic.Overall satisfactory product for my usage. But for sure not that kind of product that can be use for everything and everywhere, for that O still rely on my previous Sony earphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars

900,"This is the first time I ever purchased a wireless, active-noise cancelling stereo head set. This particular one, WH-XB910N, came charged and is super easy to use, once you've had a glance at the instructions. The extra bass makes it awesome to listen to techno/trance music. The active noise cancellation button works like a charm. You can choose noise cancellation over the ambient noise mode. The noise cancellation cuts out most types of surrounding noises. Well, I shan't be complaining any longer.So far I have discovered no flaws and am having a great time using it. Thank you Sony and thank you Amazon for bringing such awesome products my way. Will have to use it longer to say more.",5.0 out of 5 stars

910,"Awesome experience with the headphones. Packaging includes the necessary goodies like 3.5mm headphone jack, USB c cable. The case is a different level experience. Hardshell case made it easy for traveling.Sound: As we can expect from Sony. Clear vocals, great instrumental seperation, good base as it is xtra base model.For best experience of music of all categories keep the sound profile in bright in Sony headphones connect app.Noise cancellation: It is great in cutting small crowd noises, but don't expect it to deliver XM4's or XM5's level of NC.Call quality is good and the connectivity is great....Multi device connectivity works superfine, but the headphones will work on AAC codec during multi device connectivity enabled. For single device it supported for LDAC codec on my pixel 6a.Over-all the device is a bang for buck. Price to performance ratio is perfect.",5.0 out of 5 stars

915,"I am writing this review after a whole month of use. So do read till the end. I wrote few tips to improve the sound quality too at the end.Pros: 1. Good quality ANC. Completely blocks low frequency noises.2. Very good sound quality (require little bit of tweaking on Sony app, see my screenshots posted above)3. Very felixible, good passive noise cancelling through ear cups.4. Ear cups are of very good quality and can support big stick out ears too.5. Hard case for travel friendliness and protection.6. Awesome microphone quality for a bluethooth headphone. Blocks lots of external noises for phone calls.Cons: 1. Less premium plasticy build (although it is very turdy)2. Default equalizer does not sound great. One must tweak it or atleast use ""Bright"" equalizer preset mode in sony app.3. It can not block high frequency noises that well. If you need complete noise cancellation shell out 30k and purchase XM5. Do not look for 30k quality ANC in a 10k headphone. Set your expectations accordind to budget.Tips: 1. For android users out there: Must turn on LDAC on your bluetooth settings. After pairing with this headphone, go to your bluetooth setting in phone settings. Then settings for WH-XB910N. There under the codecs option turn on LDAC.2. In Sony App DO NOT TURN ON ""Connect 2 devices simultaneously"" option. It will disable LDAC and sound quality will be degraded.3. In sony-headphone-app turn on DSEE mode.4. In sony-headphone-app, for bluetooth connection quality, Choose ""Priority on Sound quality""5. I have put an image of my personal manual equalizer settings. Use that or modify it as your ear likes. If you do not like bass, reduce the clear bass all the way to 0 for phone calls. Save 2 custom equalizer, one for music/movie with bass boost, another for zoom call/video call/regular call with 0 bass. (Thank me later for these tips)These 5 setting tweak will change the music quality drastically. Check my screenshots posted above for guidance.Final verdict: Those who do not tweak these settings they will keep complaining about this headphone. But this is the best 10k I have ever spent on a gadget. S0ny wins hearts.",5.0 out of 5 stars

917,I won't write much about the quality of sound you get from the product as it is very true to what has been advertised and you can find all around the web. It is very good but the con which I would highlight here is about comfort. I do have a relatively big head but it's not huge and I am very disappointed with the comfort it gives. After 10-15 minutes of usage my ears start hurting and I have to get these headphones off before I can wear and start using them again. I am not sure who are those people who are able to wear these for hours,3.0 out of 5 stars

921,"The SONY headphones are an excellent product with outstanding features such as sound quality, Bluetooth connectivity, noise cancellation, and call sound quality. I would give it a 10 out of 10 for its features. SONY needs no introduction when it comes to quality products.However, before making a purchase, there are a few points I would like to bring to your attention. Firstly, I experienced BT disconnection issues while using the headphones with my Windows HP ZBook, MAC Book Pro, IPAD, IPHONE, and Samsung SMART TV. Although the connection establishment is quick, the headphones switch off when removed from my head and placed on the desk. This happened approximately 10 out of 100 times, and I have not been able to reproduce the issue in front of the SONY service center.Secondly, the ear cups' cover started peeling off sooner than expected, even though I always kept them in the box provided by SONY and used them gently as a single-handed user.Thirdly, cracks appeared on the head cushion within a year of purchase, which is not acceptable, considering the product's price.Fourthly, I encountered various issues while taking calls on MS Teams.Lastly, the headphones were not suitable for Apple users, as they disconnected frequently, and the sound disappeared abruptly.In conclusion, the SONY headphones are an excellent product, but potential buyers should be aware of the above issues before making a purchase.",2.0 out of 5 stars

932,"Hey Guys,I have taken these headphones only for office purposes. i really don’t care about the sound signature (as Sony’s do a good job) and stuff as I can enjoy music on any device as long as it pleasant to the ears.The mic is descent and can do the job for the office calls. I am still testing it will update you with more info.Sound - 10/10Mic - 8/10 ( There is a fan running in my room, this noise is cancelled out, sometimes it breaks the voice in doing so. But I am ok with it)ANC - 9/10 (Works effectively)Comfort - 7/10 (may be I am not used the bulkiness of headphs and vacuum created when ANC is on, will get used to it over a period of time)Battery- 10/10Connectivity- 10/10 ( I can use 2 devices at a time)Regards,Rahul YEdit: Mic is loud and clear even with a background noise of the fan. I love this, hopefully this will last long with the pad getting worn out. You can go for this without a doubt if you have the budget of 11.5k",5.0 out of 5 stars
933,"First thing first. With a product having MRP Rs. ~10K I would expect much better quality sound.Having said that, I should also mention it's not a bad product either from the sound quality perspective. The output is well balanced, not super loud, and frequency range handling is also fair. But again, that's OK from a ~10K product. I would expect much clarity, especially around the edges of the frequency band to classify it as a Good or Great product.For the microphone (verified on a computer) the voice quality is not something I would like to have. I would not use the microphone in a call unless I have to. Others can hear you pretty well, but you probably won't like your voice yourself.ANC is again nothing exciting and there is nothing to complain about either. Can not comment about the battery life as it is a new product for me.With the discounted price of ~7K, I guess it's a good deal for me. But in general, considering a product at ~10K price range it is just OK.",3.0 out of 5 stars
934,"Ever seen it was launched, had been eyeing it and finally during the Amazon Great Indian Festival, got it at an absolute steal deal of below 8k. And this price point, it's an actual no-brainer. It has the signature Sony sound with slightly bass heavy tuning for the bass heads. The gestures on the right hand side work flawlessly. And various EQ customisation just adds on to it.The only flaw to me is it's battery backup.

While watching movies, you will have a theatre like surround sound irrespective of using these on Bluetooth or AUX. MIC is also good so you are good to take calls from thisAlso, this has built in Alexa, very useful.Cons - Only thing which i found disappointing is the 60-65% effective noice cancellation. It won't cut all the noise, just some frequencies but that is something compensated with the sound quality.",5.0 out of 5 stars

ANC does its job pretty well, but don't expect it to be as cool as the XM series. The bass is not as extra as it claims, but it's more than ample for me. If you're someone so much into bass, then go for the XM3 or higher. It has a cool audio signature by default, but you can tweak it to your liking. This is such a nice pair of headphones with a premium feel.",5.0 out of 5 stars
950,"____________________Technical Specifications---------------------------------Here's the technical information of Boat BassHeads 225 In-Ear Headphones. The information provided below is as per the manufacturer. Boat BassHeads 225 have a frequency range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz. It Features 10 mm drivers. Rated Impedance of 16 ohms. Comes with 1.2 meter Flat Tangle Free Cable. 3.5 mm Gold-Plated L-Shaped Audio Jack (90 degrees). Sensitivity : 98 dB+/-3 dB.____________________Built Quality & Design---------------------------------I was not expecting metal built at this price range but to my surprise, Boat BassHeads 225 are fully made up of metal. It has a diagonal grid-like texture on the buds which feels amazing on touch. The metal construction gives Boat BassHeads 225 a premium feel & attractive appearance. The cable used by Boat on BassHeads 225 is Flat with rubberized coating, it is a tangle-free cable & does it's job well by decreasing the chances of the cable tangling. Despite the metal construction, Boat BassHeads 225 are very lightweight & comes with a microphone & L-Shaped 3.5 mm audio jack which is again made up of metal. Overall the built quality is excellent for the price & seems very durable. The ear buds have proper L & R labels and are clearly visible. Boat BassHeads 225 comes with medium sized silicone tips already installed out-of-the-box.___________Audio Quality-------------------To ensure that I can test the BassHeads 225 at their uppermost limit, I used high-quality MP3 files of 320 kbps & Lossless audio formats like FLAC & WAV. For smartphone listening, I used Poweramp music player & tweaked settings every now and then to see their extreme capability. For the computer, I used iTunes player & VLC Audio player. I also tested these earphones on Apple iPod, iPhone & Sony MP3 Player. All this went for more than 10 days & finally, I had my results.Boat BassHeads 225 promised what they claimed, they really are very bassy as compared to others. During my tests with them, I found that the audio quality is very good for the price, the bass output is amazing and overpowers the vocals by default, by tweaking the equalizer settings a bit, I saw a good level of improvement in the vocals, they were clearer than before but overall average. The treble was again very good, the high-frequency sounds were clear & pleasant to ears. The mids were average but overall the audio experience on Boat BassHeads 225 was decent. When listening to music, the overall sound quality is amazing, you can easily distinguish between different instruments & sounds which is a good thing for extra bassy headphones.______________________Noise Isolation & Comfort-------------------------------------When it comes to Noise Isolation, Boat BassHeads 225 are very good at it, They come with medium sized ear tip pre-installed which seemed perfect for my ears, once the earphones are on, I wasn't able to hear outside noise, they sealed my ears completely & delivered an immersive experience. Make sure that you have the right pair of ear tips on for better noise isolation & comfort. Overall Boat BassHeads 225 are comfortable but they seem a bit stiff & somewhat awkward when used for longer periods. Since the housing is made up of metal, you may find them popping out every now & then when used during running, jogging or any other sport or physical activity, this didn't happen as often for me but for a friend, they keep popping out every now & then while running (maybe the shape of ears has something to do with it), An easy solution to this will be using the Ear Hooks which came along with it. When using BassHeads 225 with Ear Hooks, they were a bit uncomfortable initially, but as I got used to them, they were fine, plus this stopped popping issue since the hooks keep a hold on them.-----------------------------------------Flat Cable & Microphone-----------------------------------------The cable is great, I personally prefer flat cables and this earphone come with a perfect flat cable which is tangle free & comes with a rubberized coating. The cable does its job well. The microphone is again exceptionally good, it records voice with clarity with less to no disturbance or background noise. During calls, the person on the other end can clearly hear the voice with no background disturbance. There is one button on the microphone which helps to pick up/reject calls on the go, without taking your phone out. It can also be used to control music, which is again a good to see in a budget friendly earphone like Boat BassHeads 225.____________________Warranty & Price---------------------------------Boat BassHeads 225 comes with standard One Year Warranty, so make sure you keep the purchase invoice safe, in case you need it for warranty._____________Final Thoughts!----------------------I've personally used Boat BassHeads 225 In-Ear Headphones for more than two weeks (average daily two hours of listening) before writing this review and I'm pretty much impressed with them. I'm personally a fan of Extra Bass IEM's and currently, my primary IEM is Sony MDR-XB50AP which again falls under Extra Bass category. Comparing Sony MDR-XB50AP with Boat BassHeads 225 will be unfair since there is a big price difference between both of them, but I would still like to add that BassHeads 225 did a great job and didn't disappoint me, obviously it doesn't stand a chance in front of Sony MDR-XB50AP but still looking at the price of BassHeads 225 & the quality they offer, I was really very impressed.Boat BassHeads 225 turned out to be exceptional earphones, after testing them for more than two weeks with different devices & music players, I can say that they're amazing for the price, a pure steal deal. The bass output is amazing and is very intense, I'll recommend using correct size ear tips & good quality music player like Poweramp (Android) for better bass output. The treble is good & vocals are average, somewhere I feel that bass overpowers the vocals, but by tweaking the equalizer a bit you can achieve better results. The mids are again average.*****************************My Rating : 4 out of 5*****************************____________________The Verdict---------------------------------Taking everything into account, overall I'm very impressed with Boat BassHeads 225. The Built quality is amazing, the performance is exceptionally good with powerful bass & good overall soundstage. Tweaking the equalizer a bit can bring drastic improvements to other areas like vocals, mids & highs. Overall the vocal & highs are good & mids are average but still good for the price. I'll recommend these IEM's to bass lovers & budget-conscious people who are looking for high quality & durable earphones at a reasonable price. Genres like EDM, Rock, Hip-Hop sound really great on them. Boat BassHeads 225 justify the price they come for, the results are very good as compared to other earphones in same price range.HOPE I HELPED YOU.THANKS",4.0 out of 5 stars
951,"These are some great earphones, I have received many ear tips as seen in the attached images. What's great is that they have also given the ear support which is not really all that comfortable in my ears, but it's nice of them to include it. They have given 3 white as well as 3 black ear tips, I would say go for the medium white ear tips as they fit the best and provide the right amount of sound. Bass is between okay-ish to good enough, depends on how you wear them. There is a bit too much treble but it's good for listening to dialogues during movies.

966,"If you're someone who like bass mostly while listening to music, this ear phone is for you. Loud and full of bass, I hardly used them on full volume. I'm not fan of bass or loud thumping while listening to songs...but still enjoyed my playlists of various genres with it. Good for even enjoying movies and mobile gaming. Metal finish and flat wire makes it premium in this price range...although I like it but I want to mention that because of metal earplugs...it is a-bit heavy on ear and can cause pain on long use, also you don't enjoy it while you lay down side ways...as it pokes in ear (metallic-nature) causes pain. So keep it all in mind.This beautiful looking earphones comes with in-line mic and buttons that work as playback controls.The product package contains extra ear buds which are in various sizes( S, M & L).

1000," It is a pretty good build and has a good sound quality. However, I am rating this 4 stars is because of some problem with the sound quality. In some songs, the frequency gets really high, affecting the sound quality, but most of the time is okay. Another problem is that whenever any sound is not played for a while and then played again, we cannot hear the sound for a few seconds and then we can hear again, good as normal. This happens everytime on every devices! Because of this, most of the time, In Videogames like Minecraft, Roblox.etc, we cannot hear anything unless a sound is kept playing.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1037,"QR code to download the User manual has been provided. There is a gross mismatch between user manual and product page in Amazon website.(1) According to the user manual this headphone supports BlueTooth 5.3 (which the latest version). But this Amazon product web site says BT4.2.(2) According to user manual battery lasts up to 60 hours. But as per product page, it is 9 hours only.(3) User Manual says ""Type C charging port"". But actually it is Type B charging port. Type A to Type B charging cable is provided in the box.(4) Net weight 142 grams as per User Manual. Amazon product page says 270 grams, which is almost double. It is really light weight. I don't even feel that it is on my head.Apart from the above mismatches in the features mentioned in the User Manual vs Amazon product page, I have only one thing to complain about - Corners of all plastic pieces on this headphone are too sharp. They could have been rounded for more handling comfort.I got this product for just below Rs. 500.* Look and feel are good.* Battery got fully charged within one hour when I charged it for the first time. I have used for nearly 12 hours and still there is 70% charge left (checked it thru my mobile phone). At this rate, it can give about 40 hours on full charge.* I am connecting it to my TV and watching movies. When I get phone calls, notifications are coming on the phone, that means connecting to two devices at the same time!* FM radio is working nicely.* BT connectivity is good.* Light weight and comfortable enough on the head.* Head band is provided with padding. Hand band is extendable.Getting over the ear headphones at this price is really great. Removable audio jack is another good feature of this low priced BT headphone.We can not get a budget headphones better than this.Noise cancellation, Hi-fidelity sound, extreme comfort, rotating ear cups, etc. are features that we can expect only in headphones priced over Rs. 4,000",5.0 out of 5 stars

1044,Quality price ke hisab se not good,3.0 out of 5 stars
1045,It is a really decent product...and the pricing is really good...I got this for 700 and it is still working good.Lets talk about the pros:Battery backup is really good it gives what is mentioned in the product page.It is lightweight... because it is made up of plastic (plastic quality is not bad it's not great either).Now cons:Sound is good but it is bass heavy...if you like bass heavy songs then you might like the product (just like I do some times.) But the mids are totally missing. Treble is also not that good you can't clearly hear every instrument playing in the song. so yeah sound quality is just good. It's totally depend on what you are upgrading from if you have a bad sounding earphone then you will love it but if you're using a good 700rs earphones then you might not like it.Comfort is also not great. If you're planning to wear this for long hours then it's going to hurt your ears because the padding on the headphones doesn't go around ears...it just sit on your ear... So yeah it's not comfortable for longer duration.I have two of them 1 with my sister and 1 with me. My sister one's buttons are not clicky mine are. And her's ears padding is also ripping.Also connectivity wise it's 4.2 I think so it's not good sometimes it connects automatically...but sometimes you have to connect it manually...it's not consistent at all.This product is not bad you can totally buy this for watching videos and for listening song maybe...but don't buy for gaming you just can't play games on it or for any professional use like video conferencing because mic quality is also not good.,3.0 out of 5 stars

I deducted 1 star because of the sound leakage and long charging time it took about 2 hours to charge 100%. Also the aux quality is cheap.

1076,"In short, it should only be considered as a wired headset, because the Bluetooth function isn't upto mark.You get Aux Cable with 3.5mm connectors on both end and a Charging cable with USB to Micro USB connector.It charges up pretty fast, say in an hour or so. But there's no indicator when charging is completed, it's red when charging but when full, it's still red. You have to switch on or off or unplug and replug to know charging condition.In wired mode, the sound in muffled. Microphone doesn't work in wired mode.In Bluetooth mode, connection gets distorted every few seconds, but it's not repetative, but quite random. Sometimes there's a pause every 20 seconds, sometimes every 15 seconds and so on. That's the biggest drawback.Also, Bluetooth feature gets distortion and at times completely disconnects from any device if there's much movement, like brisk walking, climbing stairs. You'll have to maintain a standard cable length distance from device when using this headset in bluetooth mode, or else distortion is inevitable.It's made of Plastic, and the headset adjustment area(the place which slides down or goes up to adjust to your head size) is sloppy. It's made of plastic grooves and after 2-3 adjustment, the headsets starts sliding down on its own weight.That's another drawback.I replaced the product to check if these drawbacks were isolated incidents but to my surprise, they weren't. The replacement headset had the same problems.This is not a noise cancelling headset, but by design, headset earcups are supposed to cover our ears, hence a false notion of noise cancellation by default. But active Noise cancellation and Environmental Noise cancellation are completely different things. This headset has none of those, but if your ears are small, then the headset cups are gonna completely cover them and give a false hope of noise cancellation.The only plus point of this headset is the Aux port and it's price, which is quite economical.",3.0 out of 5 stars
1077,I buyed this product and fully satisfied by its long life battery that of 21 hours and it's fully comfortable to wear and sound quality is also nice and its bass is next level. It's just awesome 😊👏 Hats off to zebronics for making this kind of low budget best headphones,5.0 out of 5 stars

1135,"I purchased these headphones for my office work, and I am not disappointed. The earpads are big and therefore very comfortable (unlike those ""gaming"" headsets which either cover your entire ear and makes your ears go hot, or those on-ear headsets that press so hard against your ears that they hurt by the end of the day). The microphone stick extends both ways, and the earpads fold down completely as well. Quality is FANTASTIC - very high quality indeed. The volume control and mute/unmute buttons are soft and you can tell the quality once you use them - just brilliant. For someone like me who uses headsets for over 4 hours a day, these are great. The volume is not very high like other reviewers have pointed out, and for me that's probably good - I wouldn't want to have super loud sound in my ears for 4+ hours a day. Microphone quality is really good for me - I tried the recording using Mac/Windows and the sound quality for me is crisp, sharp and captures my voice well. If you are looking for solid quality headsets for work meetings, I would definitely recommend. For music, I am sure there are better alternatives.",5.0 out of 5 stars

If a low voice person speaks in other end it will be difficult for you to hear him/her as this is on-the-ear speaker and not over-the-ear speakers.Instument(3/5): The microphone part stopped working on certain angle for me from few months ago. So nowadays I am doing a microphone test on certain angle before joining a meeting.,3.0 out of 5 stars

And then when you try to charge both pods, that one whose battery ran out faster does not get charged easily, so many times I take it out and then plug it in again and again in hopes that it would start charging but it doesn't. So you are left with 100% battery in one pod and just 10% in the other one. And as I said it can't be fixed easily or quickly because of the charging issue. And if you're anything like me, no one likes to listen to music in just one ear🙄.",1.0 out of 5 stars

1295,"I have been using these industry leading headphones by Sony, colour Midnight Blue, and trust me i find them worth every penny spent. Yes, i agree these headphones are highly expensive, some may say you can purchase Apple Airpods, Boss, Sennheiser, and other audio equipment options, but trust me nothing beats these bad boys.I am not a tech reviewer, but since being a musician, a music connoisseur myself and a huge fanatic of accessories such as headphones, earphones and smart gadgets, i can tell, these headphones are a revolution to the sound industry. I'll be quoting every pros and cons that i've personally come across and might help a few of you who decide to purchase this beauty.Pros:1. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): Let's talk about people who love listening to their music without any external interference while working, walking, running, working out, during a flight, or any other mode where they'd use them, ANC is a boon. Switch to ANC, you'll have the minimum of the minimum noise entering your ears. Only sounds close to you can reach at a very low level, else wise, you won't feel a thing in your ear. Be prepared for some bashing from your parents when they scream your name on top of their voices, and you've got that ANC kicked in.2. 3 Ambience Sound Control (ASC) ON: Apart from the ANC, there are two more features that these bad boys offer. ASC when active gives you a chance to listen to your surroundings at a certain level where you can be aware of people speaking, birds chirping, children hauling in the park, and other sounds. This feature enables one to understand the surrounding noises and doesn't feel isolated.3. Ambience Sound Control (ASC) OFF: When ASC is disabled or switched off, you can listen to your surrounding voices in a much denser state, ie. much more clearly in comparison to when the ASC is enabled. This feature is much similar to the ASC ON, just a slight difference of pitch and volume of the surrounding entering your ears.4. Head Phones Connect by Sony: Let's talk about the main functioning unit of these headphones, the app provided by Sony under the name of Head Phones Connect. You can download it from the App store if you are an iPhone user just like me, as well as from the play store for android users.This app is highly functional as well as quite intact providing a list of various functions such as adaptive sound control which is highly recommended to lazy people just like me. Once all set up, the app detects your actions and locations frequently, and switches the headphones settings automatically.In addition, if you are a daily user of these headphones just like me, the app tracks your daily attributes such as at what certain volume do you like listening you music, which mode do you mostly use, which location do you travel, and then adjusts the headphones as per your choice.One feature which at first startled me a lot but i really got impressed by it which is the Speak-to-chat feature. It's always annoying to either pull your phone out of your pocket and pause the music or to just pull off your headsets every time you need to talk to someone. This feature enables your headphones to pause automatically the instant you start speaking, and shall remain pause for about 20 secs and resume on their own if they do not detect any speech.For better sound quality, the app detects the size and shape of your ear through these headphones. This enables the device to perform better with distinct users.5. Motion Gestures: The right ear piece of the headphones has all the motion gestures such as taps for music pause/play, attend a call, play next/previous song and remove the headsets and the song pauses. These controls are highly helpful and can be easily learnt through the guide book provided, hence i won't dive deeper into it.6. Number of devices that can be paired at once: These headphones provide an option of connecting two devices simultaneously. You can connect these headphones to almost every device that has a latest and updated version of bluetooth/NFC. Devices that i've paired them with are iPhone, macbook, hp laptop, and android phones.7. What's in the box: The box comes with an impressive in-shape carrying case to carry these bad boys where ever you go. Also they include a C-type data cable for charging, 3.5mm jack cable which is quite long (haven't measured it honestly, but it is as long as a regular data cable), and a dual port 3.5mm jack converter, which so far i haven't tested.8. Battery Life: Well i must say that i am quite impressed with the battery backup these headphones provide. This device completely charges within 3 hours and trust me with an ON/OFF mode of playing music regularly, the battery stays up till 4-5 days, which is i bet a highly impressive feature which probably no other company audio equipment in this range might have.9. Voice Assist Functions: These headphones can be connected to google assistant, SIRI and alexa and perform really well.10. Easy access keys: The headphones are enable with two easy access keys on the left earphone. The custom key toggles between the 3 modes that i've already mentioned above which are guided by the in-built assistant voice. The power key pressed long enough, turns ON/OFF the device and pressed once, the in-built assist provides you with the current % of the battery left.11. Comfort: I should had talked about it earlier, but never mind. With no questions asked these headphones are highly comfortable, the cushion provided is the softest pad your ears can get. Since i am regular spectacle user, i find it hard with headphones imposing excessive pressure over the ears, making it a painful experience, but these headphones give a feather touch to your ears, even if you are specy or even while wearing a face mask. These go good with everything.12. Battery Saver: These headphones tend to power-off on their own if not in use for more than a minute which is a highly power efficient feature added by Sony to the device.Cons:1. If you are into running or any sort of longer workouts, be prepared for sweaty ears. Since the cushions on these headphones completely cover you ears, creating a vacuum sort of environment, no air flows in and out, and the sweat starts dripping down from the earphones, which i must state doesn't affect them at all, only can be slightly irritating sometimes.2. ANC can be difficult to be kept enabled every time since it reduces the environment sounds to almost negligible, which can be dangerous while running or walking at a buss street. Be very careful while using this feature. Probably it is made for environments such as while travelling in a bus or a flight, and seems suitable for these environments.3. Since these headphones can be simultaneously be connected to two devices at once, which is a boon, but is also a slight problem in disguise. Imagine your headphones are connected with your laptop as well as you phone. You are attending an important zoom call while on your laptop and the headphones are in action, your phone starts to ring, now abruptly you'll start hearing you phones ringtone, and the device gets a little startled to which device shall be entertained. i've personally faced this, but i tend not to connect them to two devices at once.PS: One highly important thing is, you won't get an experience of the sound through reading review or watching Youtube videos. You might get a fair image of weather to invest in them or not, but you'll only get the sound experience when you'll listen the music through these bad boys.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1296,"Pros:easy to charge as it uses USB c. Long lasting battery.Fits okay, but if your head is small you always feel it is going to fall.It can to 2 devices simultaneously I used with windows Android and Apple and it works well.The carry case is good to carry it as it folds and saves lot of space. Fits in back pack.Audio is good and clear. Overall build quality is good.Con: if you wear for extended period of time, it starts making you uncomfortable and gives pain in ears. Only because of this 4 star otherwise it would be a 5star.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1297,"I know there is no point comparing TWS like AirPods pro to these headphones as they both are very different but most buyers might have a fixed budget like me in which they could either go for some good TWS or Headphones.I was first leaning towards AirPods pro 2 but later on changed my mind because -1. AirPods have a fixed battery life (not taking about discharge timing), your Airpods might only last for couple of years when you will start noticing a significant degradation in battery health. Moreover, it will end up in landfill as you can’t get its battery replaced. On the other hand, In headphones like these you can get the battery replaced and moreover you can use them in ‘wired mode’ (AUX cable included) without a battery!2. Bigger drivers = more vivid sound, I am not an Audiophile but in my experience and usage I have felt that the headphones generally produce a more pleasing sound. (it could be a personal preference)Pros about XM4 -1. Good built quality, soft to touch but still rigid at the same time.2. Very comfortable for long listening sessions.3. Multi device connectivity, you can simultaneously connect it to two devices! That in my opinion is a must feature in a premium headphone. You would just need to install the proprietary application in one device and connect the headphones to any secondary device using the app, after that you can control the volume, eq and much more from your primary device (using the app). Device switching is also very smooth.4. Noise cancellation and transparency mode is also very good, keeping in mind the various modes you could choose from the app according to your liking.5. Battery life, I have to never worry about the battery life as it could last for days with heavy use and above that you can put it on charging for short intervals of time whenever you are not using it as it supports fast charging.6. Proprietary Application, the Sony app for these headphones comes with so many little tweaks and settings that could provide you with very personal experience according to your liking.Cons about XM4 -1. Can get hot, as they are closed back headphone so you could feel your ears warming up during long listening sessions.2. Might be a little big for you, as they are over the ear headphones so they may look a little big on ur head but you will get used to it eventually.3. No water resistance, so you may not be very suitable for gym during sweaty workout sessions.Overall I would highly recommend these headphones if you have the budget and you are looking for something which would last for years to come. Sound quality is amazing, fit and finish is on point, very comfortable for long sessions. I myself was using TWS in past and switching to wireless headphones was a great decision.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1298,"After a long research, I finally chose XM4 over XM5. I could have spent extra 10k if that was worth it. But few pointers that help me choosing XM4 are:-1. XM4 has better ratings than XM5 at Amazon.2. Reddit, YT, Blogs say XM5 isn't really a successor but just a competitor with slight improvements like slighter better ANC, Call quality. If you're not an Audio Engineer or a Music creator - these slight improvements wouldn't matter to you much.3. XM4 is more compact. Foldable in a hand-sized pouch.I purchased Sony XM4 headphones during the Great Indian Sale for around 20k.This review is after few hours of usage.Sound quality 🔊 - Best in classANC - Powerful💪Comfort - GreatGrip - Satisfactory (can't run with these:)Yes it's true that you can clearly hear every instruments sound. It's made for people who listen songs for a long time. Earlier have used Realme ANC-earbuds, they hurt ear. But this doesn't at all. These have touch screen gesture controls on right side - really stylish to use. One great feature I liked is you can swiftly switch back and forth between Transparent and ANC mode by placing your hand on the right side cup. I would conclude by saying as a music lover it was really a dream come true to finally own the Sony premium ANC headphones.-1 star because while walking the speakers flickers a lot. I guess these are not designed for use while running or walking. Well nothing is perfect in this world- so this is what it is.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1299,"The best part about these headphones has to be the sound quality. I also really appreciate the fact that they provided a sturdy case along with it. Been using it for more than 6 months now and have to say that i did notice some plastic creaking sound while i move around wearing them which is initially annoying and noise cancellation makes it worse, but you get used to it. Noise cancellation is also good but i have tried airpods pro 2 and (i know they are earbuds) they do a better job at it than XM4s. Overall i would say that buy them if you want a rich musical experience!",4.0 out of 5 stars
1300,"I am a video editor. This is my first Active Nosie Cancellation(anc) Headphone. And let's review it.PROS:1. Talking about Nosie Cancellation in general: using anc Headphone gives you option to block outside nosie. Which could be looked in other way i.e. you can listen in quite low volume than you used to.With anc off I am listening to about 50-60% volume with anc on its 20-30%.At the end of day your ear are much pleased and relaxed which is big thing as next day I have repeat the same.2. EQ : app has several EQ to suit different people and their different needs.And it's very easy to tweak EQ.I love flat EQ. It helps in two ways.A. Reduce listening fatigue. I use headphone 8-10 hrs and end of day I don't feel listening fatigue.I haven't have used any I repeat any headphone which not cause listening fatigue. (Listening fatigue is different from headphone clamp force)B. As video editor I do need everything in its very neutral state. And then tweak from there. So yes this is amazing.3. I used various headphone and earphone but haven't listened to anything which match it's sound quality.People talk about track seperation. You could realise with this headphone for sure.4. App is so good. People don't talk about app. It's really good and ease to use.5. Dsse extreme : It do work. It improve person talking.6. Controls : touch feels more fresh and practical as you don't look/feel for right button but there are time when you hear chime and it don't do anything.I find Google assistant works great. You can say to assistant to change to next/prev song or volume% or pause. It's super fast not like you take 2 secs and assistant think and repeat your sentence. You say, release assistant button and it's done.Plus you can do all with just a single button and as I am right handed mostly my hand is occupied with mouse or pen hence busy.And control is on right side. And assistant button on left side. If you think to invert sides it changes how next and previous work.7. Auto power off and music pause : I find this feature so useful. I hardly turn off the Headphone.Even auto pause is really good. It not work for vlc or premiere.8. Granual volume adjustable : there are time when you listen to specific volume. Like 25% not 20 or 30 it's possible. Both touch control and assistant.It may not look much but those small things make you listen you hours and don't feel fatigue at all.CONS and Feature request:1. Any anc Headphone would create a pressure in your ear. It's called cabin pressure. It's like sucking you ear with a less power vacuum cleaner.Hope it could be reduced.2. This headphone do cause heat around your ear. Well removing headphone for a minute would fix that.3. Sweat problem is for real. Its told in youtube reviews. But many headphone do cause sweat problem....again remove, clean and wear again.Both heat and sweat problem gonna have their real test in summers.4. I had expected anc to be top notch. Don't get me wrong but as first anc I expect too much. Think anc as volume reducer.I can still listen fan and some other noise.Look I am video editor and my ear had trained in a way to listen sort of sound. So anc could depend from person to personBut if you play a music at 20-25% it do reduce outside noise quite a lot.5. Battery life : company claim it's 30hrs with anc on and 50% volume.My anc is always on and I listen in 20-30% volume maybe reach to 40% as well time to time.But I have to charge every 2 day. It's like 16-20hrs battery life.I got first one replaced but second one is isn't getting any close to even 25hrs.I don't have problem with every 2 day charge. It's pretty good to me. But not matching company's standard.6. Bluetooth sometime do stutter. Turn off and now mostly fix it. But I need fixing c'mon sony.7. Hope we can use Google assistant to toggle noise cancellation and different EQ.8. Customizing option for custom button. You can make your own fav function to have.Verdict : If you someone who have to work for hours on computer or feel outside nosie act as distraction for you, you work music or video editing this would serve its purpose for sure. And yes also for travel enthusiast.Wear Headphone for 5+ hour to feel comfortable.Headphone won't cause pain in ear. But cabin pressure and heat and sweat are problematic. It won't cause headache to me. Maybe if you listen to few hrs it would make you adjusted for that.Sound is amazing. Comfort is great so does anc but those could be further improved.Look no headphone I had used in past which could match it's comfort. I actually wear for 8-10 hrs each day. Well who doesn't need more improved products.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1301,"Well, this is my first pair of noise cancelling headphones it is bit annoying for me that my ears are feeling little bit of air pressure difference while on noise cancelling mode. Maybe over a period of time. I will get a adaptation to this new technology.About sound qualityThey are loud enough & having bit more Bass heavy sound signature, Maybe out of the box you won’t find the perfect sound for yourself but after playing with sony connect app, you’ll find a perfect sound signature for your ears.About noise cancellationIt is good, but do not expect out of the world experience. It reduces down many low frequency noise but cannot give you 100% isolation feeling.Look and feel of the productO boy i am in love with the look and feel of the product, They feels so premium. Even I prefer MX4 design over MX5. Design is only the reason I went for MX4 instead of MX5.Comfort levelThey are the most comfortable headphones. I have ever used till now here design of the headphone makes it most comfortable for long listening sessions so no complains about comfort.Should we purchase xm4 in 2023As per my point of view, every new technology comes with little bit of here and there improvement and will charge you bunch of money for it where little old technology comes with great price point and almost 90% of features. So this is the best deal you can crack in 2023.Purchase adviceIf you have any store near your home, where you can experience both XM5 and XM4, then do experience it before purchasing it then make your decision because each and every person have their own sound signature preference you should experience by yourself to know which is your preference.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1305,"Please, I have nothing else to say about this absolutely lovely pair of luxury listening headphones, YouTubers will explain you why this is one of the world's best wireless noise cancellation headphones!One thing - Without noise cancellation these headphones for it's audio quality is nothing special, the audio quality of these headphones are not bad but not as good as I thought it should be for it's price before receiving it... But man is the noise cancellation something... I have tried it inside a party with 4 loud speakers booming and I have stood in front of it (where I could feel all the thumps on my chest) and whole wearing these headphones with no music playing it already was cancelling our atleast 50% of the noise (music by the 4 loudspeakers) and after playing music through it, car bassy one at full volume on YouTube music streaming at 256kbps... Damn it blocked 80% of the the speaker noise 💀One more thing that as these are proper LDAC headphones, please have Spotify or Tidal subscription if you want the full experience of these amazing pair, cause as an audiophile myself I did notice huge improvement over these two music services at their premium subscription compared to before. And this is on Bluetooth, if you feel like it's not that loud enough or whatever it is, you still have that aux option via pc (while connecting it to phone unless you have a good dac on your phone, it's not recommended as most pc motherboards have much better dac than phones)That's it, what are you waiting for?

Premium sound with customisation on app that really works.3. Dual connectivity, one of the most underrated feature.4. Super comfortable as i can use it for whole day.Cons:-1. Bad microphone for calls like super bad in noisy environment.2. Build could have been better (most of it plastic but it’s good to keep it lightweight)3. Touch controls sometimes take accidental touches.Overall i can say go for it on your budget of 20000 rupees without even thinking, you will not regret it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1311,"Obviously before investing 20K on a headphone I did my research like if this is the best or no and then and obviously this is a killer... compared it with xm3 and xm5 and also the bose ones in this range and I saw so many youtube videos but this stood out as my favourite...Next comes the deal and price, I checked the same headphones in US, Germany and Korea trust me no one is offering as cheap as Amazon India and then club it with some deals and card offers voila you got the best price. They sound soooo nice and amazing I am not a music freak and I cannot tell about this bass, treble and stuff but its perfect and its worth the 20K...Coming to the charging omg I charge once in 2 weeks I guess even after using daily... the best againOverall: Go for it, its too good and just watch out for some deals wait, you will find the better price, xD. Take care.. Drink more water :)",5.0 out of 5 stars
1312,"Owning a noise cancelling headset is a 9-year-old dream of mine. I never was able to justify paying 25 to 30k though. Finally, my wife decided to gift me the headset for my birthday. I have read and a lot of reviews for this headset online. All of them are from the perspective of a cell phone user. I use my headset mainly with my laptop and my iPad. Having dual connectivity was a must feature for me because I have a movie or YouTube video playing on my iPad and continue to work on my laptop. I take around 3 to 4 hours of zoom calls on a typical working day so call quality was also a very big priority. Now that you have the back story here are pros and cons.Pros1) Very comfortable. I use them for around 10 to 15 hours a day and I feel a discomfort after having them on for at least 5 hours. I think that is good enough session without taking a break.2) Noise Cancelling – As long as you don’t expect miracles. It does a good job of blocking the fans in my room, my laptop fan, my keyboard noise. If you have a TV on you can still hear it (although at a low volume).3) Connectivity – I didn’t have any issues with the connectivity in the two weeks I have been using this for. Connection was always stable.4) Sound Quality – I am no audiophile. My music source is Apple Music. I am happy with the way my music sounds or twitch steams sounds.Cons1) Call Quality – I am not sure if this is an issue in just my device or if it is a common issue. But, almost every time I take a call on zoom for the first 2 to 3 minutes, it sounds like other persons voice is coming from a tube. I didn’t face this issue while taking calls from phone or iPad. So, I don’t know what exactly is causing this issue but is super annoying to deal with every time.2) Battery Life – Please don’t go by advertised battery life. I never got more than 16 hours. Which is nothing to laugh at and can still last me through a working day and I can charge it once every day.3) APTX – These headphones don’t support APTX or APTX HD. As an IOS and windows user the best I can use these headphones with is AAC which is a bit disappointing. Some of my friends own XM3 and they are super happy with them on windows. My suggestion is if multi connection is not a must for you go for the XM3. They are still a very good headset and they give you excellent call quality on windows.4) Speak to chat – Even after setting the sensitivity to low it gets activated every time I hum the song even very slowly. Good that it can be turned off in the app and I turned it off in the first two days of usage.Despite the cons I love these headphones to bits and pieces. I hope the call quality issue resolves with more burn in or with a software update down the line. I used XM3s, Bose QC 25, 35, 35II and NC 700 (borrowed from my friends). I think these and XM3 have the best audio quality if you a general user. I have no idea about audiophile level details. If your budget permits and you don’t take a lot of calls on windows laptops, I would say go for these.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1315,"After lot of research, I bought this product. Thought would be good to use for meeting as well. But to my disappointment during calls the receivers says that either they don't hear or voice echoes or voice keeps fading now and then. So i ended up returning the product. If your are looking for an headset just for entertainment purpose this is one of the best. But if you want to use for official purpose as well then I won't recommend this product",4.0 out of 5 stars
1316,"Noise cancellation works reasonably well (not exceptionally great) for the user of the headphone, but if you are on a meeting; zoom for example, the listener at the other end would be able to hear background noise like people talking, TV, sudden noise of objects falling etc. Moreover listeners at the other end complained that the voice through XM4 sounds robotic. Other than that, good audio quality and comfortable to wear. Unfortunately, was not good for my primary purpose, that was as wireless headset for meetings.",3.0 out of 5 stars
1317,"If your budget allows you, look no further. These bad boys may look subtle but explicitly deliver what they say, i.e. ""Industry Leading Wireless Noise Cancellation"". Audio quality is top-notch with zero lags while playing music. The music is crisp and clear audio without compromising the bass. Tried them while at the gym and it instantly cuts out all other noise. However, since the headphone completely encircles and covers your ear, they will get wet in no time. Although it won't affect them in any way but will make you feel slightly uncomfortable.I believe these are best suited for those long journey trips where you just want to disconnect yourself from your surrounding and listen to your music/watch a movie.Again, ""if your budget allows you"" and you're a true audiophile, then look no further.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1323,"I have been using these for two weeks now, I found them super useful.So first of all Noise cancellation, Which is very good. I usually use it while reading or focusing on tasks in the office.I won't say Noise cancellation is perfect. But it cuts out almost everything that is noise. Like, When I have it on, I can hear my friend speaking next to me but everything else is just muted, like fan sound, wind, vehicles outside, etc. It has touch controlls which can be used to change volume and change songs. or play or pause. or even pick up call. And It also has this feature of speech detection, which might be useful to some people. So whenever you speak something it will turn off noise cancellation for a moment to let you hear others and let yourself be heard. For me it's not that useful, I found it annoying sometimes. So i keep it off. There's another way of talking with others, Just place your hand on right earphone when someone is saying something to you, It automatically turn on ambience mode which you will be able to hear the surroundings and as soon as you remove your hand, again Noise cancellation.The music quality is amazing. It supports hires lossless audio. I use apple music and I am even able to play 24bit 96Hz audio with so much clarity. You will hear every tune. speaking of hearing every tune...It supports two device connections at once, So If you are listening to music on your PC, and someone calls you on phone it automatically swiches output from phone, and again with it's touch controls on right side of hearphones you can pick up the call.Mic quality is decent. i won't say most amazing sound but it's good enough with noise cancellation. I had to replace the headphones once because the once i received had mic issues, But even replacement was so easy from Amazon.Battery life is according to sony is 30Hrs, in real life I can see It's pretty good, I use it regularly, I have to charge every 2 days. But also it depends on how much use I have in a day. All around it's good. And the carrying bag is very useful.Plus it's not limited to iPhones or Androids like some headphones and earbuds do. So it's a plus. It has all features accessible from both android and iOS.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1324,"I have been using this for a year now and it didn't disappoint. If you hear a high pitched noise without music and only with ANC, then you might need to properly clean the earpads (also use the ANC optimiser)And probably not use some harsh chemical or water, definitely no sanitizer, i clean it with a microfiber clothAlso the bass could have been slightly more punch-ier,ANC works really well, almost cancels out all the noise when it is really snug around the earsz it took me a while to find the best way to wear it (and using the ANC optimiser).",5.0 out of 5 stars
1325,The product was amazing and I used it for many hours now I have purchased it 5 days before and its working amazingly also it's the bass of the product is amazing it sound great is sound crisphere but if you want to use it for gym you have to be careful a little while doing your workout while doing your sets you have to put it off sometime also the performance of the music is amazing it's super it's does it sound odd or you know like it doesn't sound bad it sound very very good and before purchasing this product I was very afraid that how it will sound or will I get comfortable with it or not but believe me if you have the little experience of having headphone on your head and your comfortable with them then you will enjoy them it's great product and I will again say if you want to buy this bike had a great battery backup and amazing sound and also want to say you that if you want to use this product please use it as it is,5.0 out of 5 stars

1329,One of the best buys I made. It'd just that you continously sweat after wearing continously for a time.,4.0 out of 5 stars
1330,Build quality: Excellent build quality. Soft touch finish looks and feels very premium. Earcups are soft and comfortable. Clamping force is very balanced. Hard shell carrying case is of very good quality.Sound quality: Out of the box sound quality is poor for its price. Bass is muddy and vocals are suppressed. Treble is harsh and sibilant.After stressing it for few hours and using EQ the sound quality improved significantly. But it's still average to above average for its price range.Using custom EQ improved vocals and instruments greatly. Bass is ample on these pair and using EQ improves it's tightness and muddiness.Instrument separation is very good. You can hear every instrument clearly.Sound stage is narrow. It's only slightly wider than earphones.Noise cancellation: Excellent noise cancellation. Removes almost all low frequency sounds and greatly reduces vocals and highs. Easily on of the best noise cancellation performance on the market for the price.Ambient mode: Average quality of ambient mode. The sound doesn't feel natural it has very digital or processed feel to it. You can hear everything clearly tho.Battery life: good battery life. I have to charge it once a week. Gives me about 20hrs on ldac. Note that 30hrs specified by company is with ANC and speak to chat on off.Features: Gesture control is very good. Tap and swipe gestures work really well but it's not 100% accurate.Can connect to multiple devices.Headphones app from Sony is very good and provide with decent amount of setting. You can adjust everything these headphones through this app.Pros: Industry leading active noise cancellation.Excellent build quality.Very comfortable.Decent battery lifeGood sound quality (after EQ adjustment)Cons: Sound quality could have been better.Battery life is on lower side compared to other headphones in similar price range.Can get sweaty after prolonged use in warmer climates.Note: I bought these in great festival sale for 16.5k rupees.,4.0 out of 5 stars
1331,"I’ve been using this headphone for almost 10 days now. The sound quality and the bass are great, best in class I would say for this price range.Pros:1. Superior sound quality, good for movies and music2. Best in class ANC3. Excellent battery backup4. Build quality and matte finish are top notch5. Touch controls are very helpful, you can do most of the work without touching your laptop or mobile.Cons:1. The call quality is not up to the mark, the side tone feature is enabled by default and there is no option to switch it off.Sidetone meaning: it’s an additional or unwanted feature. Which enables you to listen to the environment and your own voice to some extent. Just to ensure you are not shouting during calls.All other brands like JBL and Bose have option to disable this but in Sony it’s not optional. Irritating most of the times2. The box or the case, congested. You have to get used to bending your headphone every time you put it into the case.3. The charging cable. Very small and not very useful unless you charge your headphone using a power bank.4. The AUX cable doesn’t have a mic. For this price range Sony could have easily added a mic in aux.5. The App, quite buggy. Inconsistent connectivity. Sometime even though the phone is connected to headphone the app shows it’s not connected.6. No option to mute the mic with the touch controls.In spite of so many cons I would still rate this 4 star just for the quality of sound it produces.Note: Buy this if you are music lover. If you are looking for an headphone for office or business calls then I would suggest you can better go for Bose 700.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1332,"This is one to recommend even in 2023 as it has all that you want from a headphones.First the sound quality is just awesome. It is full and its not very bass heavy as some headphones tends to do. To really really appreciate the sound quality listen to some .flac files using it wired. It extracts the best quality in that case.Its very comfortable and can be worn for long hours.The mic quality is not the best but can get the job done . It really cuts out the background noise if any.

1339,"After months of researching into many brands such as Audio technica, Beyerdynamic, Bose, AKG, it took hell lot of time to arrive to these.Basic requirements :- Long battery life, Hi-Res wireless, ANC, Bluetooth codec compatibility(LDAC required for Hi-Res music), long listening times - not much pressure on the jaw hinge.Pros :-+ Long battery life.+ Stable Bluetooth connection. Haven't experienced any distortion while moving around wearing these and phone put in my room.+ Codec Support - SBC, AAC, LDAC. No AptX or AptXHD in this model. If you looking for those codecs you might want to look the other way.+ Superb built quality with matte finish. resists fingerprints. Hinge folds/joints feels sturdy.+ ANC is stellar, drowns out most ambient sounds but higher frequencies could seep through but it will feel like someone is speaking from a good distance from you. You can put your hand on right cup to turn on ambient mode to talk. great feature to quickly talk and return back to music.+ Sound from the mics are also clear. People have no trouble in listening to my voice while on calls both cellular and online calls.+ It has a app by the name of headphones connect, which is full of useful features such has updating firmware of your headphones, analysing ambient sound to control ANC levels. it also analyses your ear shape to adapt sound output according to your ear shape and listening frequency. The app also tells which codec you are currently connected with.+ These also support 360 deg Reality Audio from various services and also includes 3-month trial which you can activate to listening Hi-Res 360RA audio.+ You can go wired(3.5mm cable included) and listen to Hi-Res lossless music with greater quality and clarity which current Bluetooth technologies cannot do. Even wired, you can turn on ANC and headphones post-processing tech to reproduce Hi quality music.+ Has a Proximity sensor inside the left cup which can detect wearing and un-wearing of headphones to play pause music.+gesture support to play pause, rewind, skip, volume-up/down from the right cup.Cons :- No Support to all Bluetooth codecs. The company should have given all the support at this kind of price.- I'd love to buy the white edition of these but they are not available in India only :(- Still find them expensive.I would suggest before going for these for listening Lossless music via Bluetooth and even wired, make sure your phone supports LDAC codec or else Hi-Res might not work. In the wired format, please check what kind of in-built DAC your phone has which can support Hi-Res output for at least 24-Bit/48Khz. If not then you need to buy an external portable USB-C DAC to listen to Hi-Res lossless upto 32bit/192khz.Hope this Helps!! Happy Listening :-)",5.0 out of 5 stars
1340,"Just bought these headphones on recommendation from a friend how has M3 Model of the same. So far, I am impressed with the quality of the sound and the noise cancelling.I flew from Delhi to Montreal (16 hours flight) and then from Montreal to San Francisco (6 hours flight). The battery lasted through the flight but after another 1 hour of usage at home, I got a prompt from the headphones that battery is running low so it will probably last another couple of hours. So effectively on full charge it lasted around 25 hours with noise cancelling ON all the time. Blue tooth was Not used on the plane, it was connected to the entertainment system via an external wire. 25 hours is less than what is advertised. But if it can last through out the flight across the globe, I would say it is great!Noise cancelling was very good and very similar to QC45 Bose headphones that I used while flying to Delhi from San Francisco (somebody stole my Bose QC45 on the plane so I had to buy these Sony headphones). Like Bose, It suppresses more than 90% of the plane engine noise and with music/movie playing, you will not notice the noise of the plane at all.I felt some discomfort on my ears but then realized it was the legs of my reading glasses pressing against my ears. So if you wear glasses, you will have to adjust where you put them. Having legs right behind the ears my cause discomfort.Use of buttons is intuitive and easy. The feature where it stops the Noise cancelling when you begin to talk is cool. Also the feature where it stops the music if you take off headphones is good too. Overall, I would recommend these.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1341,"Update: Thu/01/July/2021The replacement arrived, and performed exactly as the earlier device - poor microphone performance. Hence asked Amazon to return the headset, and it is now scheduled to be picked up.Tue/29/June/2021Okay, it's only Day 3 of this headset for me but I have asked for a replacement. It will arrive tomorrow, I hope it is better.I was using a 15 months old JBL 650BTC, and had a client escalate about background noise on my calls (intesntivie in his WFH ways of working from the client, but what can I say) and hence was forced to upgrade to something better. In a fit of rage, I looked at the best rated headphones and decided to pick up the XM4 over XM3 which was available for INR 8000 less, assuming that this would be an huge improvement. Yep, I made that mistake of buying in a hush.The order arrived as promised, however the Amazon bill was inside the product box, instead of inside the AMAZON packaging. I didn't think of it much at that time because I wanted to try this headset real quick. But before I provide my larger experience / review, I want to address the elephant in the this review section:IT HAS THE WORSE MICROPHONE PERFORMANCE THAN JBL 650BTC THAT I BOUGHT FOR INR 9,999There, I said it. It really is so worse. There is a huge wind noise if a fan is running even at 50% capacity which is discomforting to the other person on the call. Any background noises are not even muffled. Even when I reported an issue with this headset, the Amazon Tech specialist could clearly feel the discomfort from the moment I switched to XM4 headphones on my phone. When I disconnected from XM4 and used my iPhone, that does a much much better job at cancelling background noise - and in his words ""Oh such a relief, suddenly your voice has become sweeter"".My need:A very good headphones which cancels out noise around my background (kids playing or running around at times) for my work related calls on Teams/Skype/Zoom.Setting up:It was easy to connect the headset to my phone and laptop and it was a rather straight forward process. The Sony Headphones software is very quirky and definitely not the best out there (on iOS device). UX is real bad and it is confusing for the first time users. Took a while to get my head around setting it up. It will take a while getting used to it.Battery Life:The 30 hour battery life being claimed, has so far lived up to it. In the three days, I have used it for about 20 hours, and after charging for the first time, about 40% of battery still available. With usage this would come down as battery life goes, however this is promising.Music and Sound QualityTwo stars only because listening to music is fantastic, and it is something that I cherish about this product. That said, for audiophiles, this may be a good/better/best alternative to other phones depending on their choice of music and preferences. I enjoyed listening to the music on this device, the ANC for listen works perhaps the best I have tried (I have tried the BOSE QC35 as well) and can attest that it does a super job of silencing the outside noise for you. Perhaps the best at that, I would argue.This does not solve my problem though. I need this headset primarily for calls, and secondly for music. For a headphone this expensive, the superb microphone performance is the least you would expect! Rather, it is just a given it should and XM4 fails terribly at that.",2.0 out of 5 stars
1342,"2023 and it still the best headphones you can buy at this price. I tried my friends mark5 (xm5) but i like the sound quality of this one better simply because it's more bassy. Sound quality is excellent specially if you are playing around with its EQ setting on the app. Have attached screenshot of my EQ settings. I am not an audiophile but i am a musician and for me this headphones ticks all the boxes. Noise cancellation is also more than enough. Comfort is unparalleled as well. The only negative is that mic quality, it's not bad at all but when you have used xm5 or even boss 700, compared to those it's slightly lacking but over all this one is better due to its sound quality and it's current pricing at Amazon. Very satisfied customer.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1343,"This item was in my wishlist for quite sometime, I finally bought it and felt cheated as soon as I opened the package, I received an already unboxed item, which was definitely used before as can be ascertained by the dust on the inside of the ear cups, I requested for a replacement and amazon was really helpful.I received a new device two days later, it's a brand new one with proper packing and I was excited to use this. I primarily wanted it for my office calls and listen to some songs now and then.The main problem with this headset is the software, the sony connect app helps you toggle between various ambient modes, noise cancelling was the most hyped feature in this headset, and it works average at best, I can still hear the rumbling of fan, although subdued, it's not completely gone.Disappointed with the noise cancelling, I chose to keep it turned off for the time being, but there is no way to persist that, when ever you turn on the headset, it defaults to noise cancelling mode, that is Ok, but trying to turn it off is again is a bit confusing, you have to turn off multiple options in the sony app to turn off the noise cancelling.Coming to the audio part, honestly speaking I don't know what highs and lows are, I'm just interested about my experience, and I expected this headset to wow me, but it didn't. It was quite average, I tried fiddling with the various Equalizer settings, but nothing worked, you may think I was looking for Bass, but quite the opposite actually, I prefer the slower paced songs, but didn't find the clarity that I was expecting. I even noticed a crackling sound when playing songs.Coming to the office calls part, I took a few calls with this, the call quality was good, except for once when I heard a periodic buzzing sound, I checked with the other person if there is some noise on his side, he told me there is none, not even a fan.Major selling point of this device for me was the multi device support, I bought it just so that I can take calls both on my phone and laptop. This turned out to be another disappointment, while I was able to connect to 2 devices, the audio is completely lost if there was any sound from the second device, while audio from the first is playing, notification beeps on either device stopped sound from both devices, you have to restart the headset for it work again, this was the breaking point for me.It is comfortable to wear and has quite a premium feel, the build quality is really good. I would have been happy to keep using it if the software was any good, I feel the sony headphone connect app makes it quite difficult to use.May be go for it, if you plan to use it on a single device and not worried too much about audio quality.I have read lot of reviews on this, It has been the most favoured headset of MKBHD and many famous tech reviewers, I'm disappointed it didn't meet my expectations.",3.0 out of 5 stars
1344,"Feedback after 2 months of usage.Well what do i say. Prolonged working hours add to stress on your back. Wired headsets ensure you are leashed to you system, moreover they add stress on your ears. I spend 6-7 hours everyday over calls/online meetings. Suddenly the bulb in my head blipped and i just picked up Sony WH 1000MX4.Bonkers. Now I am u leashed. I can walk from my cabin to next without my system while still connected to my calls/meetings.The look and feel of the entire product is luxe. Ear sponge is super comfy and does not cause problem for couple of hours. But if u keep it on for hours without a break, you may feel discomfort around your ear. And that is how nature built human body.ANC is amazing. You wont even know if someone walked up behind you and is trying to talk to you if you are listening to audio.Mic quality is just great. You will sound crisp and clear. No echos, distortion at all. Tested in best way, few others i know are using same headphone and i have heard then speak on multiple devices like the same headphone, poly sync 40+, iphone & S21 Ultra.Battery life is amazing. I charge it for an hour before my day starts and it survives for ~12 hours. I am using a PD adapter.If you use this for work only and have a travel planned. Dont worry. There is an amazing hard case which Sony provides. Quality again speaks luxe.Overall I would say, dont hesitate to sped your money on this product. While some may say there are other products at cheaper rate available. But this one gives what you pay for- Best in class- sound, anc, voice, comfort & battery life and not to forget the palatial quality of fit and finish",5.0 out of 5 stars
1345,"I won't take much time and will just come to the point, i bought these at 25k in December and the first item i received had connectivity and static noise issue so i thought of returning the product as they didn't just the heavy price tag but due to return policy i first had to replace and then if i have issues with the replacement as well then amazon will consider for a return and refund. So i opted for a replacement as i had no choice so this whole process of replacement took about a week and i won't lie to you, I've grown fond of these headphones for the noise cancellation and as the ear cups were a delight and i could easily wear them all day at work and attend meetings as well. I used to have mid range Sennheiser, Sony and i couldn't wear them all day as i'd wear these and on top of that, best in class noise cancellation lured me into keeping this and not going for a return, so finally after a long invisible battle in my mind with myself, i decided to keep these and cut to February, three months later, my mic stops working and mind you, these are premium headphones and i am using and treating them with care as even though i decided to keep them, i wouldn't forget the fact that i shelled out 25k for these and boy, that's a lot of amount, at one period of time, that's more than my monthly salary so i know the importance of these and was treating them with care, YET, within two months the mic stops working and i called in the customer care and they sent me a address of a service center which is 70km away and they don't have a pickup drop service so i myself have to drop in the product at my expense and they said they don't have the parts/replacement unit ready so it would take them at-least a week's time and then i have to collect the product myself again at my own expense.I'm yet to visit the service center, but i already feel frustrated because 25k is a lot of money and this product doesn't justify that price tag and what's ironic is even after buying the product within two months, i'm still spending on this as if the 25k weren't enough already -_-Speaking from my experience, I would sincerely suggest you guys to think twice and spend you hard earned money wisely.Product Experience:I. TBH, it's a mediocre product, the sound is mediocre and will leave you in wonder, for you to think why did i shell out 25k for this piece of trash, BUT, this sound paired with the noise cancellation gives you amazing results as the noise cancellation blocks out major noises so you can hear the sound crisply even at low volumes. Again, 25k isn't justified according to me.II. LDAC is shitty and pointless:1. I'm no audiophile and as a normie i didn't notice a big difference in LDAC and other codecs like aptX.2. LDAC won't work in Multiple device connect mode so LDAC is as good as s.h.i.t.III. Touch sensor is finicky and won't work as intended when you are sleeping and wearing the headphones.IV. It pauses the playback when headphone is removed but at times it won't play the playback when you wear it back again. There are lots of features like these which are quite finicky.V. 360 Audio is horse s.h.i.t, tbh i'm not even sure what does it do and how to turn it on, this feature is clumsy af.VI. Microphones are weak and can't be used for proper calling as the pick up lot of noise from outside more than our voice and the other party always complains.VII. Battery life is decent, quick charge works well without issues (so far).VIII. I'm away from the equalizer as i'm no audiophile but it does work.Final words:If 25k isn't a huge deal to you, buy this, and only for noise cancellation. if you are coming from below 10k segment, you would enjoy the super soft ear cups as well. Other than that, don't expect anything else.",1.0 out of 5 stars

1356,"This was my first ANC headphones and I can say it's the best investment I made in 2022. I got it for 18k and it was worth every penny. I've been using it for 2 weeks and here's some tips I think might be helpful1. recalibrate noise cancellation when your wearing style and environment changes it will improve the noise cancellation you can feel the difference.2. Battery backup is solid in these can go 3 days easily. Disable speak to chat and DSEE it will improve the battery backup by 60%.3. Sound can be adjusted from equilizer according to your music taste out of the box not so good4. Be aware these do not have any IP rating so if water or dust gets inside it may cause failure or decrease it's Life span5. Keep it in the case when not in use it will be safe and may last a lot longer6. Dual device pairing is buggy my 4k Realme buds air 3 have better dual device pairing than these. Also you don't get LDAC while using this feature So, I have disabled it",5.0 out of 5 stars
1357,"I had taken a month researching all leading ANC in the price range. It all boiled down to Sony XM5, XM4, Bose NC 700, and QC 45. All of them have their own PRO's and CON's. You can watch the review on YT videos.Some are very expensive in this segment and hence I had to evaluate Need vs Want.1. Not very Expensive (in sale)2. Portable (foldable)3. Battery Backup4. It should not go obsolete in just a couple of yearsHence, I chose XM4's over the others, it's still relevant, sounds awesome, has decent build quality, you can get replaceable ear pads easily, comes with a good hard case, it cost lesser than the rest and its technology won't go obsolete in another 5 years at least. It meets my needs and serves my purpose.I use it usually to study online or video post-processing, and on the Go (traveling), etc.You will not go wrong with the purchase, yes there are many advanced ANC's Headphones out there with improved technology however it's up to individual taste, needs, and how deep you can dig into your pockets. My experience with XM4's has been awesome.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1359,"The headphones are the best when it comes to noise cancellation. With the Automatic Noise Cancellation (ANC) mode, you will not here ""most"" of the natural noises like that of vehicles, rain, etc. The communications though it will block, it is not designed to fully eliminate the noise created by people which you can see in the Sony FAQ. The sound quality is great. But there is an issue. If you are using under a ceiling fan, and you switch on ANC (full noise cancellation), you will get a sensation of wind noise coming in (to describe the noise, if you are taking a video with your mobile phone while travelling in your vehicle with the windshields down facing towards to direction of the vehicle, and you play the video afterwards, you will hear the same wind noise that you feel in this headset). The only way you can eliminate it is with the help of slider in Sony Headphones app and selecting the Wind Noise Cancellation (Wind NC) option, but that is not pure noise cancellation. You will here some ambient noise in the process. On top of that, it would be difficult to set it to Wind NC when you are connected just to your laptop. (Note: There is a windows app in github which does function similar to the slider in Sony Headphones app, and although it is buggy and not supported by Sony, it does the job.) For a headphone this costly, if it can't cancel and on top of that, add some extra wind noise, it is very disheartening. Since I thought it is a defect, I replaced the product within the replacement window, but the replaced one too have the same issue. You can see hundreds of review for the same issue in the internet saying that it happens in humid climate where there is moisture and to try ""silica-gel method"" to prevent the mosture, but nothing works when you are under the ceiling fan. (Perhaps, the product was not designed keeping Indian households into consideration and our extensive use of ceiling fans which creates a wind-like effect vertically) If you need to search for the issue online, go for something like ""static crackling sound"" keyword.I had a word with Sony technician and he asked me to go visit the Service Center. I will visit there Monday and provide further updates. If I can't fix it within the return window, I will return the product since I don't see why I should patronize a much hyped, too costly product if it can provide me with noise cancellation for my WFH but with terms and conditions applied. If you are using air conditioner, and for frequent travels, this is a great product. (Can't compare with other products since that is not my job and I don't have access to those headphones)",3.0 out of 5 stars
1360,"There are enough reviews on the web space on this product. I agree with all. These are possibly the world's best NC phones today, feature-rich and top-notch quality. I would like to mention real-world use. I will mention some niggles and drawbacks that you may or may not face:- The first issue is with the Bluetooth (BT) connection. BT, as everyone knows, has never been perfected. First time pairing is quick enough but if for some reason the pairing drops, it is not easy to reset. Please do note that I am a VERY TECH-SAVVY person. I purchased this for my uncle who is an elderly person and he faced the issue.- The controls (Volume +/-, Track +/-) are on the right ear cup. Place the finger around the middle of the left cup and move it up/down for volume and front/rear for tracks. It is not intuitive to an elderly person. I think it works for me but ... Buttons are good for elderly person but they can be too small and buttons are mechanical, prone to damage. Point is know your age and limitations.- The headphones can pair with two sources and can switch between the two. For example, one source could be the TV or Music system, the other could be the phone. The switching is not easy or automatic. For example, I may be connected to music system and while thus engrossed, if I receive a telephone call, I would like the headphones to switch to phone automatically and let me hear/speak on the call. I know that this is a feature. I have not been able to figure this out but it is early days.- The Sony Heaphone Connect app is nearly an absolute requirement and it has niggles.But overall, it is a great piece of engineering.One question often pops up Sony WH-100XM4 or or Bose NC-700 or Bose QC-35I would say between the three, purely based on sound quality, it is a toss of the coin, the Sony wins on features whereas the Bose phones are much more comfortable over the ears (I have QC-25 and QC-35 is nearly an identical sibling with wireless BT. NC is at par on XM4 and QC-35. I don't have the NC-700. Sony and QC-35 have better battery life.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The Multi connect feature ,battery backup, and touch controls are the best. I’m still playing with equaliser settings, bass is good may be a disappointment for some. Can wear it the entire day, comfort is great but it’ll sweat while walking for more than 30min or sitting inside room with only ceiling fan and AC turned off ( may be cause it’s summer not sure on this) .

1380,"Okay.... Let me get this straight.... I havent been using this headset for straight up 4 years... I have tried many a headphones and in-ears after this... But for the first 2 years i had no other choice but to use it..... I still use it every now and again these days.... And that should make my review CLEAR as i will give you all of the the wholistic view of the headphones...(MIDRANGE ONLY-audiophiles dont laugh) (ONLY HEAVY READERS MAY READ THIS WHOLE... BUT I WILL TRY TO MAKE IT AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE)For me i have tried BOAT in-ears which come around 599 or 499, JBL heasets which come around 799....and currently Jabra smart halo which was given to me.... Price is around 5000-7000.... Bluetooth headsetNow starting the review.... You must have read the above review and gotten a general idea of the sound quality and its lightweightedness...OKAY these are REALLY LIGHT and COMFY headsets... It doesnt clamp onto your ears like other on-ear headsets...PORTABILITY is on par.... The build is such that it could be folded and there are no useless curves so you can throw them into your bag and do not worry about it being crushed...The third is the main and its the SOUND QUALITY... damn... I am still shocked till this day... How were they able to pack these sounding drivers in there.... And the fact that it was available to me 4 hears ago... Probably lower than this price... I got it for Rs.499 which is just a total steal..... The sound is kinda FLAT.... And if you are a PROPER LISTENER... this is obviously a PLUS POINT.... It has a SOUND SIGNATURE very pleasing to hear and should not build up TENSION and ADRENALIN in the moments where you just want to.... SLEEP...... or relax.... Also somewhat FLAT signature lets you listen to the song the way it was meant to be BY THE ARTIST...Also the sound is WIDE...It doesnt feel that the sound is only playing inside your head... YEAH it is pretty much the best SOUND STAGE you can get at this priceNow before you get too excited... Let me throw to you some of its defects in sound like a saucy villian MUAHAHAHA.... FIRST is that of its loose fit....yea it fits nicely but after 8 to 10 months these becomes kinda loose... So the volume decreases... Doesnt effect the SOUND QUALITY though....Second is bad... But not for all...it is that it has a LOW VOLUME.... If you want to listen to high volume music.... This headphones doesnt go that far... You may be able to increase it through some apps...but it is not that high from default....Third is the NOISE-CANCELLATION.... These have almost no noise cancellation... So if you are in a loud environment... You may hear the music but only with the rumbles of the real world....(For me it is not a disadvantage as i hate noise cancellation but for many it is so I added)The FOURTH is the REAL DEPTH in sound.... Although the sound is organic... But the depth in the sound is really low.... In ears have a greater depth compared to headphones...IN CONCLUSION.... If your budget is under 700...definately get this one for comfort and relaxation... If you are a ADRENALIN JUNKIE... get an in-ear...those go up monstrous in volumes and bass...Also i think i dont need to write about DURABILTY....its been freaking 4 years and i havent had a single issue of time with this thing....Thats all for now folks...THNX FOR READING....and damn you are a heavy reader.... I owe you one",4.0 out of 5 stars

1393,"This is the second time I'm buying this product. The first time the earphone got too dirty cause I forgot it in hostel over summer break. This bad boy has done everything I expected it to, and more. As of this moment I have owned this product for over 3 years (April 2019 bought). Lets cover some distinct aspects:1. SOUND QUALITYGood. Not the best; but then again look at the price. Sound quality is one of those things that you don't really notice until something is absolute sh*t and you can't stand it. I've never felt that the sound on this one was lacking. It has enough range and clarity to beat my laptop speaker (obviously), and other in-ear earphones in this price range (plus, no hassle of stuffing those tiny buds in your ears). I've done some EQ adjustment on my phone, for this headphone, and that made the sound exactly what I was looking for.2. DURABILITYThis is the real reason you want this. This guy will not quit on you. I've two of these products in the last 8 years, and I swear I will buy another one once this breaks. I am confident that this will not break unless I drop it from the second floor.Compared to that, a Boat Rockers 450 (wireless headphones) that I bought, simply broke at the band when I stretched it to put on my head. Granted, Boat gave me a replacement through their warranty, but that product broke again, when I lent it to my dad for a day. Unless you ""know"" that you're not supposed to stretch the band even slightly when putting it on, any normal person is going to break that headphone. That is not an issue with this headphone. This is just good design, it is made to be used by normal human beings. You don't need a f*ing instruction manual. Just plug and play.If you need a dependable daily driver, I'd say go for it. Today I kind of broke my current headphone (same model) when I stepped on it. But honestly it put a smile to my face. It reminded me of how long it had lasted for me. Still it popped back into place. If it really does break, I'm going to buy the same model again. Thank you Sony.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1394,"I used this product around 1 month nice head phoneDesign, specifications and comfortThe Sony MDR-ZX110 looks fancy and expensive from a distance, with a combination of matte and gloss finishes on the body that comes across as more premium than anything else we've seen at this price. However, up close it feels strictly budget. The plastic is flimsy and bendy, and does not look or feel like it can take too much abuse, so careful handling is advised.This headset has a rather unique folding mechanism that allows the ear cups to twist inwards, into the headband. This makes the MDR-ZX110 a bit easier to store when not in use. Apart from this, the Sony MDR-ZX110 has 30mm dynamic drivers, with a frequency response range of 12-22,000Hz, 24Ohms impedance and a sensitivity rating of 98dB. The MDR-ZX110 doesn't have an inline mic or remote control, but Sony does sell a nearly identical model, the MDR-ZX110AP which does, for Rs. 700 more.The ear cups have very slight padding, which is enough for an acceptably comfortable on-ear fit. The headband has no cushioning, but is designed well and feels secure and comfortable in place. The MDR-ZX110 also has a thick, tough cable that looks like it can take a fair bit of strain. Past the Y-splitter, the 1.2m cable splits into two separate and somewhat flat cables that aren't quite as sturdy as the lower half. The design and thickness makes the cable somewhat tangle resistant, and extremely resistant to cable noise. On the whole, apart from the flimsiness, we're happy with how the Sony MDR-ZX110 looks and feels.PerformanceWith the Sony MDR-ZX110 being an entry-level on-ear headset, we did most of our testing using an Android smartphone. We also tried it with our Fiio X1 high-resolution audio player and a Windows laptop. Focus tracks for the review were BT's Somnambulist, Skrillex and Diplo's To U, and Passenger's Circles.Starting with the bass-heavy Somnambulist, we found that the Sony MDR-ZX110 had a meaty sound, with lots of emphasis on low-end attack. The bass can occasionally be overpowering, but is usually controlled thanks to the not-so-tight fit. The sonic signature has been tuned toward promoting the lows, and this makes for a very warm sound. This also tends to show a bit in the lower-mid ranges, but there is a clear sensitivity drop towards the upper end of the frequency range.Next, we cued up To U, which despite being a dubstep track, has plenty to offer in terms of the mid-range and detail. While the Sony headset is impressive in low-end detail, it seems to trail off going up the range. The result is a sound that isn't quite as open and detailed as we'd like, even at this price. Other products such as the Sennheiser HD180 offer better levels of detail at this price, so the MDR-ZX110 isn't something we'd recommend if you're looking for sonic clarity.Finally, with Circles, we kept our ears open for imaging and soundstaging. While the Sony offers a full and aggressive presentation in the sound, it falls a bit short in terms of openness and width. The sonic stage feels narrow and specific, rather than properly spread out. However, the MDR-ZX110 certainly does its bit to make your music immersive and entertaining, especially if you like your headphones bassy and aggressive.carry forward the typical aesthetic that makes Sony a popular headphone option, but it falls a bit short in terms of build quality. It feels cheap and we were always worried about damage during our time with the review unit. However, it offers an immersive, full sound that excels in its handling of bass. Detail and clarity suffer a bit, but bass-heads will not find too much to complain about at this price. If you're looking for a pair of on-ears with serious attack and drive at under Rs. 600 the Sony MDR-ZX110A should be on your wish list.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1427,"This product is worth every penny you spend on it. At this price range, the sound quality it offers is exceptional. The trebles and the bass are well balanced. You can hear the rhythm of every vocals and instruments. I read some reviews that bass is not good and sound creaks sometimes. Well guys, What more you want from a ₹600 headphone? For those who want more bass they can use a good equalizer from playstore and enjoy bass boosted sound.And regarding the creaking sound there may be several reasons three of them are,1) The product you received my be a damaged one. (I think you'd know what to do next! Simply replace it!)2) The audio jack of the device you're using may be damaged. (Change device or use different one!)3) The sound quality of song is terrible. (Now, you can't listen a 90kbps song and complain it's creaking! I recommend to use 190/250 or 360kbps at best!)And many people also complain that the sound coming from headphones is not loud. Regarding this I would say that the loudness of the sound depends on the driver of device you're using. Simply put PCs have powerful sound card and Mobiles ain't much powerful. So that's obvious that on pc it would sound louder. (In mobiles too loudness of sound varies from phone to phone)Now comes the build quality. The build quality of these headphones is also good, but it would have been better. Even tough with this build it should last for at least 1 to 1.5 years. And its obvious that it won't even last a week if you're swinging them around whenever you're carrying them!So my final verdict on Sony MDR ZX110A headphones is that, if you are on tight budget and want to enjoy quality sound and build at a low price then this device is surely for you. Don't over think guys just go for e'm!*FINALLY I ALSO READ THAT THE PRODUCT MENTIONED HERE IS OF MODEL zx110a AND WHEN THEY OPEN THE BOX ON THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL AND ON HEADPHONES ITS WRITTEN AS ZX110 WITHOUT ""A"" IN IT. CHILL GUYS ZX110A AND ZX110 ARE BOTH ONE AND THE SAME PRODUCTS.. FOR EG: IN SOME COUNTRIES IT'S BEING SOLD AS ZX110NC OR ZX110N. SO THEY ARE ALL THE SAME! SIMPLY PUT FOR THE PRICE ITS BEING OFFERED THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME!!!",4.0 out of 5 stars

1440,"***Writing this review after using these headphones for a month****Just go and search for a headphone on any of the websites and you would encounter this as one among the top recommended ones with lesser cost(I got it for Rs.499.00). If you talk about the cost of the product this is much lesser than few earphones like Sennhieser cx 180 and other. This shows the importance given by all the customers in purchasing this.Considering the above, I could confirm this as a hot cake in headphones section. Now, let me give you the pros and cons in a clear way.Sound quality: Of course this is the most important reason why we go for headphones over earphones. At the price, this headphones actually does its job really well. I have been using this for last 1 month and I didn't find any problem with this.For Normal Listeners: This sounds like a God-sent (Majorly taking budget into consideration).For Experienced Listeners:Can't explain but FEEL the bass at this cheaper price.For Audiophiles: Pay more and go for better one like Sennheiser HD 202.Design: This has an amazing design where you could even fold it easily. Never feel so heavy and portable too with huge comfort. This weights around 110 grams which is very easy to carry.On ear experience: This is the first headphone where I felt a great comfort even after using it for hours.Here are the top points of both pros and cons.Pros:1. Less weight- Easy to carry(portable)2. Wonderful sound clarity(minimum expectations from sony)3.Less costCons:1. No cover or pouch to keep and carry2.Can get scratches easily3.Plastic feels so sensitive and breakable for rough usage.Overall, This is an affordable best quality headphones from Sony for a middle class who can afford not more than 600 rupees along with Brand Warranty. What else you need for this price. you may use this for an year and then upgrade yourself for a higher one.If you found the review helpful please do press YES. :)",4.0 out of 5 stars
1441,"Highly Recommended guys. It’s durable, good base and song quality, I’ve removed one star only coz of no mic in this lovely product. For the one’s who still have phones with headphone Jack, it’sa good purchase. It also folds in to be carried comfortably.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1442,"I've been using these headphones for a year now and is in excellent condition. Well, it was, until two days ago when my cat decided to be curious about it.the best feature - comfort. I've not been able to find another brand of headphones that are so comfortable to wear for long stretches of time.like:- comfort- sturdy (it's seen some rough days with my travelling and generally careless handling.- not very expensive- decent amount of noise cancellationdislike:- sound quality - the quality is decent, but considering that sound quality is one of the primary purposes of headphones, one'd have expected it to be better. But it's still on par the with Boat and JBL products in this price range. If you are the type that relishes music, I'd suggest you look elsewhere- mic: by far the biggest disadvantage. i listen to music on my phone, so I'd really have liked to have a mic so that i don't have to change headphones everytime i get a call.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1443,"I bought this headphone just for using it at night while sleeping to hear some audio books, this is light weight and very light pressure on ear, so i can comfortably use them while sleeping or for long hours. I can say that they are serving the purpose (not for music or songs).(for my music needs i have Audio technica M30, and Skullcandy crusher wireless)Pros:Light weight, sony brand, easy to wear for long hours.Cons:Cheap feel, doesn't really feel like sony product, below average sound quality (muddy sound)If you budget is very tight and still you want to branded thing without audio quality and build quality this is your Pick.but if you have up to 1300-1400 rs go for senheiser HD206 (if you want decent audio quality, with comfortable design HD206 is best).",3.0 out of 5 stars

If you know how to use sound equalizer then it can produce sound according to ones own liking / taste.3) Wire quality is superb. And L-shaped jack is very important for durability. 3.5 mm jack precision is very good for easy plug in and plug out. Wire length is good around 1.2 meter.4) Worked both on mobile and laptop.

1493,"I stopped using it after continuously using for 3 hrs for office use. It can not be used for long duration calls or back to back meetings. Ears starts paining after 2-3 hours use. Speaker cover is very thin. I will give this device to someone needy.Sound quality and built quality is nice but comfort is huge issue with this device due it's tight overhead band. It keeps both sides on ear for getting better sound or noice cancellation. But the one who is looking for noice cancellation will buy over ear bigger headphones.I use all types of headphones, over-ear, on-ear, earbuds. Earlier used Sennheiser on-ear headphones but it never gives pain.Ideally if anyone buying on-ear simple headphones then it is for calls or meetings where they still want to hear sound in their room. Some attention to sound in your room, for example keeping an eye on kids while being in meeting. Basic padding or multiple layer soft covers for on-ear will be helpfull.Guys go for iBall rocky over-ear or Cosmic Byte over-ear wired headphones for long duration office calls. It cost less compare to this Logitech device.However this is still good buy for upto 60 mins use for 1 session/call/meeting and then a break.

Very usable for video calling.The best part is, even turban wearers can use this headset, though not in the traditional way. Wear them as a behind-the-neck headset (rotate the boom microphone accordingly) and thanks to the friction of the foam earcup cushions on the pugree, they will stay on. Try it both ways for the fit: left earcup on the left ear and vice versa and stick to the fit that works best for you.Adjust the headband to adjust the clamping pressure, though you'll probably want to keep the headband on the smaller side. Their pressure doesn't spoil the pugree.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1525,"I recently purchased the Boat BassHeads 162 earphones after hearing many positive reviews about its powerful bass and affordable price. As an avid music lover, I was eager to test them out and see if they lived up to the hype. After using them extensively for several weeks, I can confidently say that the Boat BassHeads 162 earphones offer an impressive audio experience at a budget-friendly price.Design and Build Quality:The Boat BassHeads 162 earphones feature a stylish and minimalist design. The earbuds are ergonomically shaped, making them comfortable to wear for extended periods. The cable is sturdy and tangle-resistant, which is a huge plus for everyday use. The overall build quality feels durable, and the earphones appear to withstand moderate wear and tear.Audio Quality:The highlight of the Boat BassHeads 162 is undoubtedly its bass performance. The earphones deliver deep and punchy bass, which is fantastic for bass enthusiasts and those who enjoy genres like EDM, hip-hop, and pop. However, it's worth mentioning that the bass can sometimes overpower the mids and highs, causing a slight imbalance in the overall sound signature. Nonetheless, for bass lovers, this might not be much of an issue.The midrange is generally clear and decently detailed, while the highs could be crisper. Audiophiles may find the treble to be slightly subdued, but for most casual listeners, this won't be a major drawback. Overall, the audio quality is more than satisfactory, considering the price range.Noise Isolation:The Boat BassHeads 162 earphones come with passive noise isolation, which does a decent job of blocking out external noise. It helps create a more immersive listening experience, especially in noisy environments like public transport or busy streets.Comfort and Fit:As mentioned earlier, the earphones are designed to fit comfortably in the ears. The package includes different sizes of ear tips, allowing users to find the perfect fit for their ears. I found them comfortable even during long listening sessions, and they stay securely in place during physical activities like jogging or working out.Microphone and Controls:The built-in microphone works well for calls, delivering clear voice transmission. The in-line controls are easy to use, allowing you to adjust the volume, skip tracks, and answer calls conveniently without reaching for your phone.Conclusion:The Boat BassHeads 162 earphones provide excellent value for their price. The powerful bass response, comfortable fit, and durable build make them a great choice for budget-conscious music enthusiasts. While the sound signature might not suit everyone's preferences, especially those seeking a more balanced audio experience, the BassHeads 162 still delivers an enjoyable listening journey, especially for bass lovers. If you are on a tight budget and looking for earphones with a focus on bass, the Boat BassHeads 162 is definitely worth considering.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Everything works totally fine.Haven't tried SD card playback (I don't need to).Related to calls (didn't test), i do not prefer over the ear headphones for calls, so i have a alternative neckband for calls. So can't comment on that.But i would recommend not to go with white like me. This is like pure white. So any small dirt or scratch will get noticed easily. Go for darker colours unless white is necessary.Build is nice and doesn't feel cheap.honestly very good deal for 1.5K not gonna lie.And let me be super clear, this is NOT A BIASED or paid REVIEW.

1645," It is a pretty good build and has a good sound quality. However, I am rating this 4 stars is because of some problem with the sound quality. In some songs, the frequency gets really high, affecting the sound quality, but most of the time is okay. Another problem is that whenever any sound is not played for a while and then played again, we cannot hear the sound for a few seconds and then we can hear again, good as normal. This happens everytime on every devices! Because of this, most of the time, In Videogames like Minecraft, Roblox.etc, we cannot hear anything unless a sound is kept playing.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1682,"QR code to download the User manual has been provided. There is a gross mismatch between user manual and product page in Amazon website.(1) According to the user manual this headphone supports BlueTooth 5.3 (which the latest version). But this Amazon product web site says BT4.2.(2) According to user manual battery lasts up to 60 hours. But as per product page, it is 9 hours only.(3) User Manual says ""Type C charging port"". But actually it is Type B charging port. Type A to Type B charging cable is provided in the box.(4) Net weight 142 grams as per User Manual. Amazon product page says 270 grams, which is almost double. It is really light weight. I don't even feel that it is on my head.Apart from the above mismatches in the features mentioned in the User Manual vs Amazon product page, I have only one thing to complain about - Corners of all plastic pieces on this headphone are too sharp. They could have been rounded for more handling comfort.I got this product for just below Rs. 500.* Look and feel are good.* Battery got fully charged within one hour when I charged it for the first time. I have used for nearly 12 hours and still there is 70% charge left (checked it thru my mobile phone). At this rate, it can give about 40 hours on full charge.* I am connecting it to my TV and watching movies. When I get phone calls, notifications are coming on the phone, that means connecting to two devices at the same time!* FM radio is working nicely.* BT connectivity is good.* Light weight and comfortable enough on the head.* Head band is provided with padding. Hand band is extendable.Getting over the ear headphones at this price is really great. Removable audio jack is another good feature of this low priced BT headphone.We can not get a budget headphones better than this.Noise cancellation, Hi-fidelity sound, extreme comfort, rotating ear cups, etc. are features that we can expect only in headphones priced over Rs. 4,000",5.0 out of 5 stars

1689,Quality price ke hisab se not good,3.0 out of 5 stars
1690,It is a really decent product...and the pricing is really good...I got this for 700 and it is still working good.Lets talk about the pros:Battery backup is really good it gives what is mentioned in the product page.It is lightweight... because it is made up of plastic (plastic quality is not bad it's not great either).Now cons:Sound is good but it is bass heavy...if you like bass heavy songs then you might like the product (just like I do some times.) But the mids are totally missing. Treble is also not that good you can't clearly hear every instrument playing in the song. so yeah sound quality is just good. It's totally depend on what you are upgrading from if you have a bad sounding earphone then you will love it but if you're using a good 700rs earphones then you might not like it.Comfort is also not great. If you're planning to wear this for long hours then it's going to hurt your ears because the padding on the headphones doesn't go around ears...it just sit on your ear... So yeah it's not comfortable for longer duration.I have two of them 1 with my sister and 1 with me. My sister one's buttons are not clicky mine are. And her's ears padding is also ripping.Also connectivity wise it's 4.2 I think so it's not good sometimes it connects automatically...but sometimes you have to connect it manually...it's not consistent at all.This product is not bad you can totally buy this for watching videos and for listening song maybe...but don't buy for gaming you just can't play games on it or for any professional use like video conferencing because mic quality is also not good.,3.0 out of 5 stars

I deducted 1 star because of the sound leakage and long charging time it took about 2 hours to charge 100%. Also the aux quality is cheap.

1719,"This headphone is best among all of them I bought till this date.This headphone is perfect example of ""Value for Money""Although its cushions gets torn after usage but those are still usable, they just lost their plastic coating.Aux jack stoped working after 6 months of intense usage but it works fine with Bluetooth which is better option than putting Aux cable in every device.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1720,"I have received black grey color. Good and premium looks. Light on ears do not pressure ears too much quite comfortable to wear for longer time too sound is decent not too loud. Bass is quite nice decent when connected to laptop but on mobile it is half. It has fm, micro sd card and aux support that is also works well.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1721,"In short, it should only be considered as a wired headset, because the Bluetooth function isn't upto mark.You get Aux Cable with 3.5mm connectors on both end and a Charging cable with USB to Micro USB connector.It charges up pretty fast, say in an hour or so. But there's no indicator when charging is completed, it's red when charging but when full, it's still red. You have to switch on or off or unplug and replug to know charging condition.In wired mode, the sound in muffled. Microphone doesn't work in wired mode.In Bluetooth mode, connection gets distorted every few seconds, but it's not repetative, but quite random. Sometimes there's a pause every 20 seconds, sometimes every 15 seconds and so on. That's the biggest drawback.Also, Bluetooth feature gets distortion and at times completely disconnects from any device if there's much movement, like brisk walking, climbing stairs. You'll have to maintain a standard cable length distance from device when using this headset in bluetooth mode, or else distortion is inevitable.It's made of Plastic, and the headset adjustment area(the place which slides down or goes up to adjust to your head size) is sloppy. It's made of plastic grooves and after 2-3 adjustment, the headsets starts sliding down on its own weight.That's another drawback.I replaced the product to check if these drawbacks were isolated incidents but to my surprise, they weren't. The replacement headset had the same problems.This is not a noise cancelling headset, but by design, headset earcups are supposed to cover our ears, hence a false notion of noise cancellation by default. But active Noise cancellation and Environmental Noise cancellation are completely different things. This headset has none of those, but if your ears are small, then the headset cups are gonna completely cover them and give a false hope of noise cancellation.The only plus point of this headset is the Aux port and it's price, which is quite economical.",3.0 out of 5 stars
1722,I buyed this product and fully satisfied by its long life battery that of 21 hours and it's fully comfortable to wear and sound quality is also nice and its bass is next level. It's just awesome 😊👏 Hats off to zebronics for making this kind of low budget best headphones,5.0 out of 5 stars

But if I wear it for too long my ears pain since I'm a eye glass wearer. So that's the only complaint from my side. Apart from that, it's really good.

This buds are only for bass lovers not for dolby sound lovers. It's bass level is very high & clarity is very low.

1782," I recently got my hands on the Ptron Bassbuds, and I must say, they have been quite a pleasant surprise. As a budget-conscious consumer, I was initially skeptical about their performance, but after putting them to the test, I'm impressed with what they offer for the price.Sound Quality: The standout feature of the Ptron Bassbuds is their audio quality. The bass response is punchy and powerful, as the name suggests. For bass enthusiasts, these earbuds won't disappoint. However, the bass isn't overpowering and still maintains a good balance with the mids and highs. The overall sound signature leans towards warmth, which makes them ideal for genres like pop, hip-hop, and electronic music.Design and Comfort: The design of the Ptron Bassbuds is sleek and compact, with a glossy finish that gives them a premium appearance. The earbuds fit snugly in my ears and come with multiple ear tip sizes, ensuring a comfortable fit for extended use. I appreciate the inclusion of touch controls, which are intuitive and responsive for managing playback, volume, and calls without reaching for my device.Battery Life: The battery life on the Ptron Bassbuds is quite impressive. On a full charge, I was able to get around 4.5 to 5 hours of continuous playback, and the charging case provided an additional 20 hours, which is more than enough for my daily needs. The USB Type-C charging port is a welcomed addition for quicker and hassle-free charging.Connectivity: Pairing the Bassbuds with my smartphone was effortless, and they maintained a stable connection with minimal dropouts during use.Call Quality: While the sound quality for music playback is excellent, the call quality on the Ptron Bassbuds is average. Callers on the other end reported my voice to be slightly muffled, and the built-in microphone didn't provide the best noise isolation in noisy environments.Final Thoughts: The Ptron Bassbuds offer exceptional value for money, providing an impressive audio experience at a budget-friendly price point. They excel in bass reproduction, making them a great choice for bass lovers. The design, comfort, and battery life are commendable, and the inclusion of touch controls is a definite plus. While the call quality could be improved, it's not a deal-breaker considering the overall package.If you're on a budget and seeking a pair of wireless earbuds that deliver on sound performance and functionality, the Ptron Bassbuds are an excellent choice",5.0 out of 5 stars

1837,According to the price of 2000Rs it is a very good device. 30db anc works well in a room with loud ac or fan. Battery backup is also good. Build quality is good and the hinges are also great. Overall great product with great looks.Only complain is it is scratch magnet. It will scratch soon without proper cover.,4.0 out of 5 stars
1838,Right now I'm using this earbuds for around 20 days and the sound is very satisfactory. The bass and treble is quite clear and I think the sound quality is really good for the price. But there's only one single flaw in this device which is the latency. While gaming I almost hear sounds after like 55ms which is apparently equivalent to 1 second almost. The packaging says they provide a latency of 40 ms but it's not even close to 40. Hence the earbuds is a big no no for multiplayer games where sound is a key factor. Overall the conclusion is phantom 700 is good for music and casual gaming.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Look for earbuds with high-quality drivers and possibly support for advanced audio codecs like AAC and aptX for improved wireless audio quality.Comfort and Fit: Comfortable earbuds are essential, especially if you plan to use them for extended periods. Look for models that come with different ear tip sizes or ear wings to ensure a secure and snug fit for your ears.Battery Life: Long battery life is crucial for uninterrupted listening. Look for earbuds that offer several hours of playback on a single charge, and a case that provides extra charges on the go.Connectivity: For wireless earbuds, consider the Bluetooth version and its range.

1873,the sound quality and design are really good but the build quality could've been better,4.0 out of 5 stars
1874,"After almost 3 weeks of usage, it feels value for money. Battery backup is fine for my usage. Sound quality is also very good at this price range. App support and Noise Cancellation mode is very much appreciated. One thing to keep in mind is that the case and buds itself felt very premium when I bought it. But both will get scratched very easily. We have to be extra careful while handling it. But to be fair we cannot expect much more in this price range. I'm happy with the product as of now. Will update if anything goes wrong.UPDATE:I faced some issue regarding the spontaneous activation of google assistant and followed by a shutdown of my earbuds. Don't know what caused the issue. I kept my buds aside and not used it for few weeks and the issue is now solved. Meanwhile, I raised request for replacement under warranty, and they responded to the mails I have sent. And pickup was scheduled. But no one contacted me for pickup. So now I am using the same buds which I received for the first time. Also app is not detecting that my earbuds are connected, most of the time. Even though I'm listening music through the buds. Not sure whether it's my phone issue or buds issue.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Using it more regularly for songs and mainly for teams calls. The wire material is quiet good. It is not that plastic wire but some different material.Dislikes: Button sometimes doesn't work. Unable to lift the calls or pause the music because of that. Every 4/10 times this happens. We need to speak with mic close to our mouth. It is like we need to hold the mic close to our mouth or else the other person cannot hear us properly. And finally left side speaker stopped working from today morning September 2023.

1889,"Wire earphones, also known as wired earphones or headphones, are a popular choice for many people due to their affordability, reliability, and compatibility with various devices. Here are some key aspects to consider when evaluating wire earphones:1. Sound Quality: The sound quality of wire earphones can vary depending on the brand and price range. Generally, they offer good audio performance with clear and balanced sound reproduction. Higher-end models may provide enhanced bass response and better overall audio fidelity.2. Comfort and Fit: The comfort and fit of wire earphones are subjective and depend on individual preferences. Some earphone models come with different sizes of ear tips or additional accessories to ensure a secure and comfortable fit. It's important to find a pair that suits your ears well to minimize discomfort during extended use.3. Durability: Wire earphones are generally more durable compared to their wireless counterparts since they don't have delicate electronic components like batteries or Bluetooth modules. However, the quality of materials used and build construction can still affect their longevity. Look for earphones with reinforced cables and sturdy connectors to ensure they can withstand daily wear and tear.4. Noise Isolation: Some wire earphones offer passive noise isolation by creating a seal in the ear canal, blocking out external sounds. This can enhance your listening experience, especially in noisy environments. Keep in mind that the level of noise isolation can vary between models.5. Connectivity: Wire earphones typically use a 3.5mm audio jack, making them compatible with a wide range of devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and audio players. However, it's important to check if your device still has a 3.5mm audio jack, as some newer smartphones have transitioned to wireless or USB-C audio connections.When choosing wire earphones, it's recommended to read customer reviews, compare different models, and consider your personal preferences and budget.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I have ordered replacement as no return option is available the the replacement is just as pathetic as the prior one. I did see the option to return them but nobody came to pick these up and the status reflecting as ""Return Pick-up Verification Failed"". I guess the courier guys must have seen some dreams of picking these up according to which they mentioned the above-mentioned remarks. I guess online shopping doesn't worth it anymore.

But at this price, that was expected!Sound quality - It's pretty good! With amazing battery life, I could even watch three movies in single charge.Bluetooth connectivity and range is good. Gives me enough flexibility to walk and talk in my meetings and I have even tried walking approx 60-80 steps away from my laptop to get some water or coffee.Problems:1. It's not at all good to be used with wind. If I am walking in a windy environment, the other person on the call can hardly hear me, I did not expect this from Bose at all!2. Dual connectivity works well, but is more like a pain to me. If I am in a meeting 9n my laptop, and my phone rings:2a. Automatically my meeting goes on hold and headset gets connected to phone. Now, that I am not interested to take the calls, I disconnect it and then it connects back to laptop, but I lost the conversation... There should be an option to set the priority device in the app.2b. Even worse - when I disconnect the phone, and connect back to meeting, the other person says that my voice is not clear and there is a background noise. So, I have to drop the meeting and join again.KiFor this reason only, I disconnected my headphone from mobile's calls. But then that means this feature is waste and of no use!Finally, I am thinking to sell it and buy Jabra",3.0 out of 5 stars

1960,"The microphone is touted to be ""near boom quality"" by Bose, but no such thing when using Bluetooth on a Macbook Pro (2022 model). It sounds digitally processed, thin, almost unrecognizable from oneself. Reportedly, this is due to a limitation of the Bluetooth spec. This would be fine if the included cable carried microphone output to get around this limitation, but in wired mode the mic is disabled, leaving Bluetooth as the only option for calls. The Macbook's built in mic is vastly superior, so you can switch the input source to the Macbook or another mic (I tried a lavalier also) while using the headset for audio output, but in this configuration the built in feature to hear oneself referenced in the headset is disabled, resulting in your voice sounding muffled and inside your head. Treat this headset as primarily for audio and only sometimes for laptop calls... otherwise, check out the JBL Quantum 100 + Rode AI-Micro for the best headset mic and direct mic referencing in combination.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1961,"Astounding noise cancellation, beautiful design and poor quality software support.1. The noise cancellation is unrivalled. A truly worthy competitor in this field. Compare it with the world’s topmost racing cars in the field of noise cancellation.2. It looks and feels like a piece of modern art. If you have an eye for sleek design, minimalism and “less is more” thought process, you would appreciate these. Pitch it against any other headphone in the market side by side, and you could see the difference in build quality and design superiority.3. Software. Bose should fire at least half of its software engineering people. Looks like Bose doesn’t quiet really know what Quality Software means in 2021. Buggy iOS app, pathetic support site etc. it looks like Bose spent a ton of money in hiring top notch UI/UX designers and cut corners by hiring stupid and cheap app developers. The can’t be said to be reliable at all. It looks like force fit component in an otherwise beautiful and rock solid product which is worthy of being put at MOMA (Museum of Modern Art). I am guessing Bose relies heavily on third party software developers who don’t have any idea of what a “Bose” product really means and who the “Bose” people are. In all, software is a huge let down.4. Innovation and features. The world has made major technological advancements extremely fast and Bose seems still locked in its own research labs and in their ivory towers. Why Bose? Why the attitude? Why are you not adopting the best codecs available out there? Who says you have to clutter your product? Look at Sony and Apple and learn from their best success. Don’t think that you can remain hidden in your own research labs and can do all the innovation yourself. Because, a day might come, you will be paying a heavy price for this. If you don’t innovate and compete, you will die.Summary:This product would have been an undisputed leader 3 years ago, but not right now. Sorry Bose, others like Sony and Apple have worked very very hard and they deserve the respect and the market a bit more than you for this product.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1964,"Edit:I’ve got a replacement (chose a black one this time) after mailing Servify and attaching them my chats with US Bose Support where the support staff indicated they replace products with this defect in the US and India.Build Quality: [Refer pictures]This is what the headset looks like after about 6 months of use, the color is fading, the cushions are torn and the stems creaks every time I take a step. Mind you, I've never even taken the headset on jogs, or under the sun and I dutifully replace these in the case after use.Service Center:For the company handling the service in India (Servify), none of these qualify as issues. I was asked to mail Bose USA or tag them on Twitter to get a response. After spending a quarter of a lakh on the device, I'd have expected much, much better resolutions. In the US, the color fading issue qualifies for a complete replacement. Why this double standard for Indian customer for whom the cost is much dearer?Bluetooth:The connectivity isn't that bad, but isn't great either. When you connect two devices at the same time, you get a lot of sync issues when listening to audio.Voice calls:This is what I bought this for and its microphones are THE BEST. Coming from AirPods Pro (which picks up everything from the street dog to cosmic microwave background radiation) this was a true revelation to use. My friends finally stopped complaining about the incessant barking and my drowned out voice. The ANC isn't perfect, but it works for most mildly loud environments.Sound:Even the songs you've heard for decades will sound new in these. These bring to center stage even the most feeblest of sounds and sets apart those composers who put their heart and soul into how their songs sound.Buy this if you want a balanced sound and great call quality, but won't worry if you hear the hinges creak and the color fade as fast as this device arrives.",1.0 out of 5 stars
1965,"Software Issues:So I bought these headphones in Jan this year and initially faced many issues regarding connectivity, as it was painful to switch between two devices, but as I knew beforehand so I made peace with it, but trust me its an understatement that the software is bad, its almost unusable on bad days,Anyway, I made peace with it as I bought them for Active NC, and that's the best part, Bose got at least one thing right thank god.Hardware Issues(on my unit):So they worked fine for a couple of months and then I started having issues with the charging port, it sometimes worked other times it won't work it was a hit or miss, but after about 1.5 months ago it stopped working completely,Customer Support:so I contacted their customer care to report the issue and get them fixed, it was easy to contact them but they were untrained professionals who didn't even know the model number and were not able to understand the issue, after much effort I got them to register my complain and that's when the frustrating part begins, they just registered my complain and didn't do anything about it, I called again and they said they are looking into the issue and I will get a call from them, waited one week for that then called again and they said I have visited or to send the my headphones to their service center, luckily I was able to convince them to pickup the device themself which took another week and 3-4 phone calls as again they seem to forget about it.its been more than 3 weeks now that they have got the device but customer support don't have any clue now as to what is happening, they just say I have to contact the service center for further info, the service center manager was nice and updated me that headphone will be replaced with new ones as they were under warranty, but again she didn't know when will they receive the replacement and said I have to talk to customer care to get them delivered to my house which I know will take more than 1 week again and that if she receives headphones.Let's see what happens, I may update this review after I get my replacement headphones.TLDR: really bad user experience when connecting multiple devices, horrible customer support.ps: if you like Bass-heavy music or good software experience go with Sony, If you like the best ANC with the best microphones and crisp music go with Bose.",2.0 out of 5 stars
1966,"For windows and android users, 90% WONT work ""properly"".For mac and ios users, 80% will/might work properly.Very disappointed with this product overall.Sound quality- Just like any other previous bose headphones. Nothing extraordinary considering the price. However due to the improvement in noise cancellation you might hear the audio a bit more clearer.Should have kept my 8 year old reliable QC15.I bought my first pair and returned and got it replaced with a new one because when I connected to my windows laptop (Dell XPS 15 9560), random stuttering/hiccups/cracking sounds came up when listening to almost anything. However, it worked seamlessly with my iphone 8 and macbook air (mid 2012 model). Tried couple of times calling Bose India support, no one picked up. Spoke to the amazon customer care advisor and he told me that this is not compatible with other OS systems other than Apple. But I was not convinced because Bose didnt mention anything about that in their website and also from tech reviewers, who reviewed it using windows and android OSs. I asked for a replacement and finally got a new pair today.Unfortunately, it is far worse than the previous pair. Infact, it not only has the random stuttering/hiccups/cracking sounds (For windows), but also a weird hissing sound from the left ear cup which makes my left ear painful (For both windows and mac). Please bare in mind that I tried all troublshooting methods which were discussed in the Bose community forums and nothing worked. Now I have to return it without any replacement because amazon can only replace this product once which is a shame.I bought this for 29,741rs on the 16th of October 2020 and now it costs 29,999, which means if I want to try it again, then i have to spend extra 258 rs and if that has another problem, then again replacement and maybe return.Honestly, this is by far the worst Bose product that I have ever bought. Extremely sad and very disappointed with Bose considering the premium price for this product.Both these pairs that I received, were manufactured in December 2019 and I bought this during the ongoing Amazon great Indian festival period (October 16th 2020). I dont know whether these problems have anything to do with the manufacturing year.So, if You are considering this headphones, please be prepared for a long ride with its issues if you are an unfortunate one like me.I must say that I literally fell in love with its design and also, my mate has the same headphones which works seamlessly on his iphone 11 pro max and on his windows laptop (Acer). He convinced me to buy this, but I was very unlucky, although, I wouldnt blame him either. I reseached about the problems I faced with the nc 700s and I found many people were unhappy with it especially after a month's use or a year's use. So dear folks, be careful when you choose this product and dont fall in love blindly with its design.I have to return it anyway. Planning to try QC 35 2.I hope this review helps.All the very best.",1.0 out of 5 stars

1968,This is my first ANC headphone and wasn’t sure what to expect. I am very happy with the noise cancellation - especially on Webex or Teams calls. I haven’t faced any audio quality issues in about 1 months. The sound quality for music is amazing. So clear and all instruments rendered well.The only con I feel is it is a bit uncomfortable to wear for hours together. After 2-3 hours I get pain and feel ears getting warm and sweaty a bit. I get it that for NC it has to form a tight fit around the ears and hence maybe unavoidableThe foam is pretty soft. Not sure how long it will last.Overall happy with the product and recommended,4.0 out of 5 stars
1969,"Pros -- Call quality is excellent plus it cuts off ambient noise while you are talking which is great. So if you are into taking lot of calls then this is the perfect choice as it keeps you focused as well ensures the quality of your voice renders perfectly to the listener on the other side.- Looks modern and sleek.- ANC is really good with choice of setting the level unlike QC35ii where there is zero, mid, high with NC700 you can choose individual range for what is low what is mid and high.- Ear pads are really of great quality and fit perfectly- Sound quality is balanced renders natural sounds without adding too much of effect but if you like thump then may not be the best one out there.- Touch controls are really good esp to pause by just double tapping is really neat- Putting it in the case is pretty easy unlike the foldable qc35ii. I've read reviews where people preferred foldable ones but in my personal preference keeping it in the box is pretty easy compared to qc35ii where you had to figure out which side to fold and then take care while putting it in the box that you have used the padding perfectly.Cons- The metal band makes it a little heavy compared to qc35ii and you can feel it during the initial use but will get used to it.- Butons are very flimsy and don't give the feel as qc35ii controls, they have tried to make them small and sleek but in doing so have made them really to thin and looks to be of cheap quality- Not much difference in sound quality compared to qc35ii so not a big upgrade if you are planning for.- Pairing with the app to start using it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1970,"I have this problem with my recently purchased bose nc 700. I basically use it for MS Teams and Zoom, and I'm on the latest software version of the headphones as of today. I thought using my 700s would be a nice things for work calls, since they're not getting any use for travel! If I connect the 700s to my computer via Bluetooth, they work great for Teams and Zoom ""use computer audio"" options, but YOU CANNOT MUTE! This seems to be because the button on the headphones is only programmed to function as Mute when you are on a ""call"", such as in using your connected phone. But it cannot seem to tell when I'm using them on a Teams or Zoom meeting, so the button still functions as the Assistant shortcut, thereby doing nothing when I'm on a meeting. Thus there is no way to mute myself using the headphones, which completely defeats the purpose of using them and having a wireless headset. If I have to Mute/Unmute I have to do it on the computer within the Teams or Zoom call. I can't believe Bose doesnt have this functionality. Between missing Music Share functionality and the inability to mute myself, these 700s are not worth the month. I'm so disappointed in Bose.I have seen that UC version does support this but now i am terrible scared to purchase bose without due delingence.Moreover in Bose US or German portal a separate UC can be purchased but i still don't see that option available in indiaA bit tight ear CupIt's 10 day of use...only so will update again",3.0 out of 5 stars
1971,"Great Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones without any doubt a True Blue Bose.But, the firmware / software definitely not upto the level of Bose. This is my first Bose and I am overwhelmed with the quality of the sound. I chose NC 700 as it can connect two devices over Bluetooth simultaneously. This is of great help (especially these days of Corona driven Webinar/WFH days) and it helps me to be present in web-meetings through PC/Lsptop and also take phone calls (android smartphone) seamlessly. Unfortunately, though it worked brilliantly with Cisco Webex, it didn't with Google Meet. However, it worked flawlessly with Microsoft Team. One issue however is that, while I am in a meeting and a phone call lands on my Android phone, NC 700 straightaway switches to my phone. This, though a great technology use, but is unwanted, as I am cut off from the meeting abruptly and others in the meeting have no idea. Whenever it happens I get an message though on my laptop that my mic is lost. But I don't know whether others who are present in the meeting get any message etc. However once the phone call ends, NC 700 switches back to my meeting on the Windows laptop.Also, the Bose Music App sometimes respond poorly. I had to reboot my NC 700 twice. Hence not 5-Star. Hope update versions of firmware and app takes care of this.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1972,"I love sound. And I have over 9 headphones and IEMs. And this one is simply the best.I am not those people who likes a heavy base - I'd rather go in for quality of sound. And sound I believe, should not be polluted by environmental noise.The Bose 700 is a marvel of tech that blots out 90% of external sound. So, noisy fans, the drilling going on in the next door magically disappears at the touch of a button.The sound: I heard the lockdown diaries by Roger Waters (basically an acoustic version of his Floyd songs). And I could hear, every crash of the cymbals with as much clarity as his thick raspy voice. I also watched The Punisher on Netflix. And boy! The sound of machine gun fire, sounds like machine gun fire. So full marks to Bose on the sound.The only trouble I am facing is, when I have to switch from watching Netflix or YouTube to a Teams or a Webex call. The audio just gives up. And I can't hear anything. Still working on it to solve the issue.Oh, and it is expensive - definitely can be cheaper. I would also check out the Sony 1000XM4 too. They are supposed to be a Bose killer.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1973,"[UPDATE AFTER 10 MONTHS]The headphones are made of very poor quality material. The earpads literally start dissolving and finer materials are falling each time. Considering that I've literally paid the most amount in an headphone, this has been pathetic. Contracted Bose and it's not even available. I can understand that due to Covid things aren't good but they literally don't pick up call, nor will they accept their manufacturing fault (search for NC 700 Silver Discoloration).Stay away from BOSE, it's better to get Airpods or buy from genuine brands such as SENNHEISER.[ORIGINAL REVIEW July 2020]I have been using these for a week now and I was hesitant at first before buying, because one, it was too costly and second, the reviews that have been mentioned doesn't give good promises. But I took the plunge anyway, but I am glad I did. Jotting down all the false reviews as mentioned:1: Yes, it does support Windows (Windows 10, 1903) without any issues whatsoever. Have been using them for Zoom, Hangouts and everything else for all my meetings and it works flawlessly with noise cancellation. Also using as a headset for games work too. You just have to select the sound output from Volume icon to Bose Headset. No crackling or static noises.2: You can use the headphones without the Bose Connect app too. You just won't get the option to change your equalizer settings (yes it is present after you update the headphones), or fine tune your noise cancellation, but it just works like any other Bluetooth headphones out-of-the box.3: Bass Not Present - I think this is personal preference, but once you update your headphones, Bose has added EQ on the Bose app. You can increase the Bass to +10 and it does sound heavy and not distorted. Overall the sound quality is good on mids and very clear on high treble. If you want Bass, then you shouldn't be looking for Bose in the first place.But I wouldn't say there aren't any hiccups with this.- The battery life is stated for 20 hours but I am only getting 16:45 hours on a full charge. This is because they advertise it without noise cancelling on.- I see many people reviewing this without 'Verified Purchase' tag on reviews, which is very weird and just praising XM3s. While XM3 were my preference too, but the only single connection at a time was a let down for me (rumors that XM4 would have multi-connection support).- High price, it should have been around 28k - 30K.I think Bose has also fixed many of the issues from earlier reviews and is now a solid choice.",1.0 out of 5 stars
1974,At this price point everyone will know there will be no compromise at all.Bose has done a excellent job.1.Sound quality:Once upon a time i was a pure bass head😂 i thought that Bass is the only thing which will make you to enjoy the songs and music but when my friend gave me to use audio technica for some days i was completely blown away by the sound quality which was too realistic and detailed after that i have started to hate the extra bass bcoz more bass reduces the actual sound quality it may feel rich while listening to songs but while watching movies you can notice the loss of audio quality dramatically.Coming to this product the sound quality is well balanced highs mids lows are perfect its really a pleasure to hear music from this headphones.Comfort:This one is not definitely comfortable as bose qc 35. I didn’t got any pain in my ears but its getting bit warm while using for some hours. For those who prefer more comfort especially when you use headphones for long hours i would suggest QC 35 II stills its a best from bose.Battery:Battery is the only thing which always disappoints me when coming to the Bose. Am getting roughly around 16 to 17 hrs when ANC is ON even when the ANC is off battery life is not so impressive but the good thing is it can charge faster at least.Noice cancellation:No words to describe the ANC its the best in the market right now better than sony wh 1000mx3.Verdict: Its definitely a great product for audiophiles but the price is the biggest setback of this product atleast for under 30k it would be a great product to buy....but when the special sale arrives you can get QC 35 II under 20k so personally i will recommend you to go for QC 35 which is best value for your money or else you can wait for some months and you can get this product at a deal price during specials sale days.Overall worth for the price.,5.0 out of 5 stars

I was confused between Sony XM4 and Bose 700. I wanted headphone for my office meeting which can block background noise and at the same time is comfortable to wear for a long time.Answer :Long AnswerAnd after using this headphone for more than multiple hours I can say :1. If you are really into bass go for Sony xm4. Though you may see review and claims that sony are the leader if Noice cancellation headphone but I would say in NC sony cannot beat BOSE.2. I bought this headphone for one and only one reason - noise cancellation during the call (office meeting) and hearing good music. This headphone can satisfy both the requirement. Sony noise cancellation on a call is really really bad. I believe the main reason for buying sony xm4 or bose 700 is noise cancellation and Bose is way ahead of sony. Trust me.

1978,"After reading a lot of reviews for the amazing Sony Wh 1000XM3s and doing my own research I thought it is better to try both the pairs of headphones and i can honestly say Bose NC 700s are definitely the better ones out of the two,In terms of ANC i think sony blocks out a little more noise but it gives you a kind of plugged in feeling when you wear sony but when it comes to bose they are so comfortable, you actually forget that you are wearing any headphones,The build quality of bose is awesome, the stainless steel headband looks and feels very premium,The sound quality is awesome, but i would suggest better to try them before purchasing, as audio quality is basically something which should be experienced before making any decisions, as you are the best judge, close your eyes ,listen to music and decide which of these headphones is best.Now i mostly listen to Country music, which sounds magical on these headphones you can listen to those banjos, fiddles and guitars clearly as if each one is played live in front of you.I dont listen to a lot of pop, hip hop and EDM so wont be able to comment on that.I also listen to bluegrass music which sounds good too, but you should make your decision on the basis of the genre of music you listen to like EDM, metal, grunge, blues , jazz etc,for eg if you like a lot of base you can go for the beats by dre studio 3Bose also gives updates through the app like they have recently added the equalizer which was awaited for a long time,so all in all a very good pair of noise cancelling headphones which will be liked by a lot of people.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Comfort wise its very good probably best in the market at this price.Two things i want to mention.Firstly its stopped attaining 100% charge after few months and now it never prompts battery full even if its on charging for 24 hours. You mostly get 15 hours of battery life after a period of 3 hours of charging.Secondly its ear cushion covers are falling apart recently.

1980,"Overall: Full disclosure. I have not bought this product on Amazon. Picked up one at the closest Croma electronics store since there is no price difference. The best noise cancellation headphones I have used so far. Used to use Bose qc35 II, qc20.Audio: Yes, the bass is not that great.. but the bliss of noise free environment supersedes high bass.Mic: I use it primarily for calls and the mic quality is really amazing. It picks up my voice clearly even in a really noisy place. The other party on the calls won’t even realise that I am outside most of the times.Battery: this has a friggin beast of a battery. My typical day usage contains about 4-5hrs of calls and 2-3 hrs of music/Netflix. And with this usage it lasts me just shy of 3 days on a single charge. This is more than enough for me.Connectivity: with iPhone7, there are some connectivity issues. Once in a while it just disconnects while in the middle of a call or while swapping between multiple calls. Didn’t observe any connection issues with media consumption. Also didn’t observe any issues with one plus 7T pro, MacBook and couple of other devices. So I’m guessing the connectivity issue is more of an issue with the iPhone rather than the headphones.If you ever want to invest in a good set of headphones, invest in these rather than 10 pairs of sub par ones over time. Get it on EMI or pay for it. 35k may sound a bit more for headphones but trust me they are totally worth it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1982,"After testing multiple brands over months and finally buying this product; I can say the follows:Bose 700 is the best Wireless Headphone available today with ANC today In this price range - Period! There are better wired headphones or costlier Bluetooth headphones available BUT this is by far the best ANC Bluetooth headphone.1. Let’s start with sound quality:10/10 of you care for clear sound where each instrument and vocal shines; this beats all others in the market head down. Sony WH- 1000XM3 doesn’t even come close. You will hear sounds in a song you have never noticed before and within second you will emerge in deep vibrance of your playlist. It does justice to all genres. Base, midrange and Highs all shine. Also, don’t let the review comparing sound codecs fool you; because on IPhone or Android; the sound quality beats every other headphone.2. Noise Cancellation (9.5/10): Second to Sony WH- 1000XM3 however; if you put music on (which I am assuming is the purpose) ANC will be same as the Sony. The great thing about this headphone also is that it has no cabin pressure or ambient noise with ANC on; which is perfect.3. Call Quality (10/10): This is best Bluetooth headphones for calls amongst all headphones available. If you are looking to use the Headphones for music as well as calls; don’t give it a millisecond thought. I would rate the Sony XM3 at 5/10 compared to this.4. Battery Life and Comfort 10/10: At this price, these become basic. I was worried about comfort as I had read some review which showed concern. However, these headphones are sleek, look elegant and are super comfortable.",5.0 out of 5 stars

For long hours you can hang with it.For sound quality, if you like softness (not heavy bass) in the music, this for you.When u increase volume to the full, it's sometimes hurt your ear.No bose AR for Android user yet.Noise cancellation works fine but further it need to be improve.Even bose app don't have amazon music integration for indian user. For sportify, need to subscribe. So, no use of app till now. May be further,they can improve.Calling is too good.Why I bought this because of it's design and light weight. It's seems to be fit in your ears as with sony, feels like big and heavy. Most important, this is in initial phase of development. Might be they improve in coming version in terms of App.",2.0 out of 5 stars
1988,I was looking for a best NC headphone for work from home as well as high quality music. I believe my search ends here.Bose NC 700 overwhelmed me with superior noise cancellation and best music output ever. Although bass lovers may not quite like it as the audio output is well balanced with right level of bass.I am also amazed by excellent call quality from phone or with MS Team office meetings. Noise canceling works like charm with associated Bose Music app. You can pair this with 2 devices at a time that is missing in Sony XM3sConnecting to Windows 10 laptop is slightly tricky. You’ll have to add win 10 laptop as source and pair it in WINDOWS 10 device settings.Cons- clamping force is slightly high compared to QC series of Bose headphones,4.0 out of 5 stars
1989,"As NC 700 had 8 mics I thought it would be better for calls, and bought it.Since day 1 It gives Robotic voice on WebEx call or Slack calls. And checked on Bose community it is not solved since long time. Even on latest firmware update 4.x it’s not solved checked on 6th July.Also despite lock down relaxed in Bangalore the only service Center of Bose is never opened.Really bad experience after buying 35K headphonesWith regards to noise cancellation also not really happy.Update:Returned the older ones Replacement works with Webex calls.Newer headphones Manufactured after Jan 2020 works really well no Robotic issue any more on new ones.On calls its crisp and clear. Noise cancellation is good on calls I have a AirCooler running making huge noise, People on other side of call dont complain about it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1990,"So i bought both the Sony WH-1000xm3 and Bose 700 and both are wonderful in their own ways, to me I liked Bose 700 a bit more just because it is a bit more comfortable for sure than the sony and the design most importantly, its stylish and wonderful, feels premium.Sony do have a wonderful bass without a doubt and it wins for sure in the overall sound quality.Both are wonderful in their own terms its on the buyer to see what he wants. Personally I love my Bose 700 and my Sony WH-1000xm3 would for sure say if you're going to buy the Sony ones buy the xm4 as its probably out now if i am correct and its wonderful. So make sure to buy the latest and newest version if you're spending this much money on headphones.I did hear some people talk about bose app issues,Welp i used the bose app and it never gave me any problems so far it worked like a charm and had no issue at all.Its a really well made app and works for me pretty well. Its probably because bose has fixed the app as people do complained about it and i am Glad bose is listening to its customers.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1992,"I bought this for its mics. It had the best microphone quality in all the reviews and websites due to the 4 microphones. However, the bluetooth multipoint implementation is the worst and the most terrible I have ever seen, Even cheap headphones quarter the price, has better bluetooth multipoint. If you connect it with 2 devices, it randomly disconnects frequently without any warning, ABSOLUTELY FORGET about taking calls with this, while connected to your laptop. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES THIS HAS DISCONNECTED IN BETWEEN CALLS. This is the worst implementation of bluetooth multipoint ever. I generally don't write reviews, but I am doing for this one, at 5 in the morning because I am so frustrated and disappointed with such an expensive product.If you want to use it connected to only one device, then the build and sound are very good. But I would suggest you take a hard look at anker's soundcore QC35 before pulling the trigger on this.",3.0 out of 5 stars
1993,"I was very skeptical by reading the negative reviews. I am using BOSE products from past seven years. My decision to buy Bose 700 is not disappointed me. Below is my feedback.It works without BOSE music app.I connected to my Airtel Xstream box flawlesslyWorking fine with my OnePlus mobileWorking perfectly fine with Windows 10 laptop. (You need to make sure the Bluetooth drivers are installed correctly in the laptop)The sound is very crisp and clear. If you are expecting artificial high bass, stay away from this product. BOSE gives you crystal clear natural sound. Very good for listening music and movies. Also, good for calls. You can connect two Bluetooth device at a time.It is recommended to install Music app. First time when you connect, it will update the device firmware in the headphone. You can control the Bluetooth device using the app.Finally, noise cancelling is amazing. You can set the different levels (0 to 10)of noise cancelling in the app. Once you make to 10, you will be in different world, you can’t hear anything from the surroundings.BOSE is BOSE . go for it. :)",5.0 out of 5 stars
1994,"Overall comfortable is very good I can wear it for several hours at a stretch , ANC is very good. And the design is so minimal it feels great .. the battery I tested it last for more than 22 hours . The surrounding audio experience is very good , I can easily distinguish all the instruments and vocals in a song . The touch in right earcup is very responsive . For audiophile people I'd say go for it because the listing expirience is better than Airpod max However you can get it in half price .For gamers I'd suggest not to buy it because there is some latency but there is is a 2.5 to 3.5 jack included with it in box , you can use that one",5.0 out of 5 stars
1995,Works like a charm but the cushions wear out in just over a year time.

2000,"I bought it last year and have been using it since then almost 6-8 hours per day. For listening to music it's a good headphone but not worth the price. For using it in office to attend meetings on zoom or teams, it's pathetic. My Jabra headphone works a lot better. Recently I started facing wierd issues such as sudden disconnect, crackling and buzzing noise, lags, sometimes not able to connect to my computer at all. I reached out to the support team almost 2 months ago when my headphone was under warranty, and I am still waiting for someone to pick my headphone up and get repaired. I am also ok to go to service center myself but there's no clear advice to follow yet.

See everyone goes thru the review before buying. consults various online platform and ppl to get the best information about the product and more often than not it finally comes to choice, preference and cost. I faced the same dilemma between bose and sony XM4. what made me select bose was that it always will be a pioneer in noise cancellation. i mean i have tested it with an IPL match being played at high volume and my wife talking me while standing next to me and it worked. i couldnt hear a damm thing ;) . controls are simple and to the point nothing fancy or complicated. looks are amazing and elegant.

2009,"Sound and Noise cancellation are top notch. No problem and that is expected from Bose at this pricepoint of 31K INR.I am supremely upset with the ergonomics and the bluetooth. Here is the list of issues that I have experience over the last 1 month:1. Bluetooth range is poor2. When phone and laptop are connected it is extremely difficult to toggle between the two. Eg. if you are on a voip video call on laptop and get a sms on phone then the video call blanks out for approx 5-7 secs3. ergonomics of the headset are very unwieldy, if you are sitting down and after a while want to lie down then the headset comes off from top due to the weight4. cannot leave it hanging in the neck for more than 15 mins because of the weightAbsolutely lacklustre product from Bose. Not worth the premium. BUYERS BEWARE!",3.0 out of 5 stars
2010,"Sound quality and noise cancellation are outstanding. The major problem is the material it is made up of. After a year of use the polish on the headbands started to come out. After 2 years of use, it started looking even worse. It seems worse than some cheap headphones.I thought Bose headphones are really good, but I am utterly disappointed with this one just on the cheap materials part.I would not recommend it to anyone. It looks stylish initially, but polish starts to come out after 8-10 months.",1.0 out of 5 stars
2011,"Noise cancellation is great but feels the Bluetooth connection or voice communication shall be better.Can't use for longer period of time as it gets little heated up around the earpads.Price is obnoxiously high, doesn't really justify as quality is not that great as expected.Packaging is of premium class , device is very smooth for a feel good factor.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2012,"This is my second Bose product, but I am sad to say that the sound quality is not up to mark. Forget about the Bass, even the mids and vocal sounds are not that great what other reviews claimed. Again like I said , since I have another Bose product (true wireless earphones) I can see the issue over there too.Noise cancellation is okay, but compared to Sony 1000x4 it is of no match.The touchpad is very responsive and I liked it, but the sensor's touch area is very small.The app sucks. It frequently disconnects the product, and the EQ often does not make me feel the difference in sound quality even if I pump up the Bass or Treble. Utterly pathetic app. Again compared to it's rival Sony product, the app lacks features too.Finally I chose the white color variant because it was relatively cheaper than the other color variant. But it is prone to attract marks and dirt. My son put some crayons on it and I can't remove it now. So don't go for this color variant at all.Overall, it is disappointing to see that Bose products are not value or money. On one hand they make a hole in your pocket and but on the other hand the value proposition is less and you would get better and cheaper options than them, e.g. Sony 1000 series, Hifiman, Audeze, Grado Prestige series etc.",2.0 out of 5 stars
2013,"Sound quality is amazing. Obviously that is something we expect since it's a bose. I ordered this headset specifically for its multi device connection.

But what really impressed me is that these headphones have different levels of noise cancelling & also a conversation mode wherein you can have a normal conversation without having to take off your headphones. The gesture controls are easy to use and make the experience all the better. The build quality of the headphones is another area where Bose has simply hit it out of the park.

Very very dissappointing.The compulsory requirement to use app on your phone is extremely annoying. The touch controls are also very unfriendly. Gimmicks. I had cancelled the call accidentally couple of times. The mandatory use of app for doing basic things like switch device requires you to constantly be paired with your phone. I have lost calls some times because of an incoming phone call hijacking my headset. Not expected from something so expensive. Please make things useful not fancy.,3.0 out of 5 stars

I have these earphones from 4 months and these haven't tangled since. Also the rubber coating and the inside braided wires gives a nice looking effect.But 1 thing I have seen is the middle piece which have a mic and buttons is 180 degree reversed. so, many times it's difficult to pick the right or left earphone without seeing. But it is mentioned on the earphones so that becomes easy.Now about the main part the internalsThe sound quality is so so nice. 😊As you can see in my title. Solid 8/10. You can listen any music like lofi or peacefull type and when it's time for a party you can listen rock, bass boosted songs with such a adorable quality its the true definition for true sound and at cheap prices.Bass quality is also good.perfect for the ears. And if u want high bass, I tried it with max bass it can produce and that's awesome. But don't listen high bass for long. Those can hurt ur ears really bad.But noice cancellation is 4/10.seems like there is no noice cancellation. Maybe its mentioned for the mic not for the earpiece.Obviously there are very high quality products then this product but those will alteast cost 2000. But I will choose this product instead of a 1500 one or less than 1500 because this cost less than 500 or sometimes less than 400(depends on sale) but quality and services of these products are not less than of a 2000 rs earphone.In past, 1 of my earphone died but the coustmer care is so generous, there services are so cool and quick. So those got replaced within 3 days. (it's 3 days because I forgot the eslip, if you mail them with everting ready it won't take more than 2 working days)It's an honest review by me and I will definitely suggest you to but these. ☺️🙃Edited:-Their services are slower now. Don't know why and it takes around 1. 5week to 2 weeks to get the refund. If something happens to ur earphones.Also its been like 1 year as of 1-9-21And I saw some trend with it. My brother earphones stop producing sound from one side evey 4 months or soBut mine earphones be with me for 5 months.It's not a problem though cause you can mail 'em regarding this.

It doesn't look that bad tho, it has a premium finishing feel to it. Audio quality is intensively great. I don't think you'll ever get this much audio quality under 500₹. The audio quality feels like if you are wearing a over-ear headphones. It has a pause/play button and a volume slider provided. Noise cancellation works but i can still hear my surroundings a little bit. Speaking of bass, Yes there is bass. But it's only little amount of bass. If your budget is 500₹ and you want great audio quality and a feel of over-ear headphones, go with this. But if you are here for the stylishness of the headphones, look for another one.",3.0 out of 5 stars

2158,"The only thing good with this product is the sound quality from the earpods. Contrary to how it has been described it DOES NOT charge fast and it DOES NOT run for 35 hours continuously, even after charging for 10 hours straight, YES I've tried even that. And most of the times the battery of one of the earpods runs out first and faster than the other one, it's not fixed which one, sometimes it's left one other times the right one. And then when you try to charge both pods, that one whose battery ran out faster does not get charged easily, so many times I take it out and then plug it in again and again in hopes that it would start charging but it doesn't. So you are left with 100% battery in one pod and just 10% in the other one. And as I said it can't be fixed easily or quickly because of the charging issue. And if you're anything like me, no one likes to listen to music in just one ear🙄.",1.0 out of 5 stars

I don't feel pain even though wearing them for a long time.6) ANC mode is pretty decent... It does suppress the background noise.7) Dual pairing device.Cons:1) The product is completely made of plastic so don't know the life durability.2) The control buttons are bit harder.3) In dual pairing... I don't know for what reason if the device is connected with my mobile.... It is not getting connected with my laptop until I disconnect it from my mobile.... Once it is connected with my laptop I'll connect it back with my phone. (Not sure if everybody is Facing this issue)4) Normally the pause button works on youtube...

Excellent experience, fits well to the ears, does not cause heaviness even for long hours of calls, excellent noise cancellation and good mic.Coming to this piece that i bought from Amazon, poor sound clarity. Have not seen much bass coming, feels heavy within 20 mins of usage. The package was delivered with seal open. I returned once but again the same. I could clearly distinguish the sound difference since i was using the same model headphone for over 2 years now. Is it a problem at seller end or sony has manufactured a defective headset, i am not sure. Also is it just my feeling since the seal was broken when delivered.. Now who knows the truth. I leave it to readers best judgement before choosing to buy this item from Amazon.",5.0 out of 5 stars
2252,"A highly ordinary headset. Hard to believe it is rated over 4 stars. The rating system will lack credibility if such inflated ratings persist. The music sound quality is rather ordinary. The call quality is pathetic with peersistent loud static noise. Could be a quality issue. Moreover, buyers beware: there is no return option, only a replacement one. I got lucky because they didn't have an item to replace mine. Those who want a USB headphone, I suggest that you go for a Sony headphone with a 3.5mm jack and buy an adapter for USB C.

2259,"These are my observations & feedback after using Sony Extra Bass MDR-XB450AP for ~ 1 week:+ MDR-XB450AP is a closed type, on-ear headphone with 3.94 ft long Y-type cord.+ sound quality is amazing, crisp and clear with boosted bass punch.+ looks are good, with classy metallic finish.+ build quality is sturdy and durable.+ headband is also sturdy and amazing. It is adjustable to suit your head.+ the cushioned ear-pads are comfortable to the ear which also helps to enclose or seal the music perfectly.+ noise cancellation works perfectly.+ it sports a tangle-free cable with looks durable, the length of the wire is perfect, neither too long nor too short, you can easily sport it outdoors.+ it is fold-able and easy to store, really portable.+ lot more comfortable than other headphones out there in this segment, not too tight and don't slide off easily.+ I didn't faced (yet) any issue of heating up of ears.+ one thing which I was interested in knowing but was not able to gather much details before purchasing, was the performance of mic. After using I can say it is really good and do the intended job perfectly. I use it for voice calls and all feedback I got from the other party about the quality of voice was always positive.+ now an important thing about the authenticity of the product as a lot of fake Sony headphones are in circulation in market. Sony has issued detailed guidelines on how to validate if your purchase is authentic. Posting a web link is not allowed here, so just search for the words ""microsite mdrcaution index.html"", most likely it will be the first link in google search results. Following are the three things you need to check and in my case I found all in place correctly, which confirms it is an authentic one with a July 2017 import date:>>>>> 1 year warranty sticker.>>>>> MRP sticker.>>>>> correct bar-code, ending with (E) or (IN)On the flip side:- bass can be overwhelming and little too much at times.- I did feel a little pain after 2+ hours of continuous use, but I would like to believe that is normal and a matter of getting used to it. Just want to highlight.SUMMARY => Overall, an excellent product in ~2K price segment. You can definitely go for it.Pictures posted for reference. I hope this helps.Should you need any further information, do leave a comment below, I'll definitely try to get back.",5.0 out of 5 stars
2260,"When I first got the product, it was already opened, looked used (which it was), and was defective (right one was not working at all). There was no clear plastic wrapping on the sony package. Very disappointed with amazon.I called amazon and they said they will replace for free, and if the second product is also defective then they will return my money. The second one came in 3 days and I handed over the old one to them. The second one was an unopened package, and working fine.Now PROS and CONS+ sound quality of this Sony MDR-XB450AP is at least TWICE as good as my old Sony MDR-ZX310AP.+ bass is strong and it just feels like the sound is coming from bigger drivers, which it is not.+ passive noise cancellation due to the tight fit and good quality pads is a bonus.+ build quality is very nice. feels like a premium product. It looks pretty too.+ flat cable, I dig it!+ when I increase the volume, the headphones just keeps giving more!+ the mic works but nothing special about it. But I didn't buy it for the mic.- as mentioned above, the fit is tight, and that can be a problem. Sweat + Pain after extended use.- if I am nitpicking it feels like it is missing something, in the mids and highs.UPDATE- I'd wear MDR-ZX310AP for a whole movie without taking it off but with this new MDR-XB450AP I'd giving my paining and sweating ears a break every 20 mins.VERDICTNot worth it since it is not comfortable.

Easily go for it. This is my first day using them I love it.,5.0 out of 5 stars

Better base, louder and the sound is more clear.But the durability could be better, as the ear pads tore off from the foam just 1 year after purchase.

2276,"I have been using sub standard headphones previously, which needed me to keep my volume levels at 60% and more sometimes depending on the website.

My previous headphones even at 100% volume levels would sometimes not catch some dialogues or important sounds making it a very unsatisfactory experience. Similar problems with some other websites too like watching Snyder cut on bookmyshow. These headphones give a brilliant experience at 36-45% pc volume levels and obviously for music lovers , this gives a very good experience, bass et al. Wearing it for too long (4-5 hours zoom call) did give a slight discomfort in the ear.

It reduces the background noise to half the moment you wear it.

I have received better quality sound in boAt Bassheads 900 wired heaphone that costs only 700 rupees. I have used this device on iPhone, Oppo, OnePlus and Sony phones, and found the quality to be disappointing. Worst part, YouTube doesn't have an equalizer setting, so you have to adjust with the extra bass muffled sound.Giving it three stars because a product far less in price such as boAt is giving unmatched clarity.

It is good for music and online class and most importantly it is comfortable for hours. Yes, in HP the reviews was like the earcups leather gave out within days and using the headphone for 1-2 hrs will start giving head ache and ear pain. So Sony was just opposite. It is made with materials that last long and the cushions are comfortable and the wires were tangle free and it is tangle free as advertised by Sony. So for casual users and online students and teachers, this one is for.you if you are in a budget. The only con was the absence of cushion in the head band and no volume control in the AP Remote . And the Amazon package came in a very bad shape. It was like as if they pressed the front of the package , so I thought it was refurbished but it isn't, the packing was hampered so it looked like that.",5.0 out of 5 stars

But after a month or so when I listened a song on my old in-ear headphone I wasn't feeling anything, but I felt really good on Sony MDR XB 450AP. And like I said, movies feel really good.THE MAIN PROBLEM is that you can't lie sideways with this headphone on. You just have to lie straight on bed while listening to music on bed time.

2297,"::::ONE STOP FOR BEST DETAILED REVIEW:::- I can speak for Iphones user perspectives because i use iphone 6s & 7 as my daily driver. So before starting boasting about its best point I would like to shead some light about which could be a tad off frm perfection:——Downside:—1) for those who are thinking that others ve mentioned about its music gets muffled out some times than thats true but that only happens in Higher EDM musics where bass boosted to max throughout and sound gets behind the bassbeat!! Thats because we crank up the music to max and the headset itself starts shaking, its like ear massage!!2) for someone who sweats a lot stay away!! U can feel little sticky around ears specially if u r thinking of using it outside in hot summer than its a big noo!!3) these aren’t workout wears,maybe jock can do but gotta be cautious!4) there are no replacement pading for earcushing , so mind to put it back at better place best into its box, thats y they ve gave it for product durability!! PeriodPro:—1) BASS BEAT SHAKERS VIBRATIONS JUST ENOUGH!!2) Max up volume to get beat effect dont worry it doesn’t hurt ears at all!!3) Cares mid ,lows and higher tones are excellent!!4) best brand value at this price point , i got this @ 1800 ,this is upgrade to xb450 so specs wise its mic but it has better mids as per my experience!! Amazon has just two officials Sony dealers so check google before buying!! Dont buy just because u find it cheap in some sale from any random because there are tons of fake products !!

Ears will also hurt if you are wearing spectales.Performs really well in terms of clarity and bass is noticable. Really good thumping bass. Headphone kinda vibrates when playing songs with low bass. I feel the bass is just not enough to shake your skull. Maybe this is what you get for 1700rs. If you have used headphones around 1000 rs then this one will sound similar to them. I also own a 999 rs Mi in ear headphone and it is really close to this one in terms of bass.

Rough use possible, no worries there.music pleasure:pleasure level is good. cushions are nice.cushion is made for cancelling outside noise from disturbing the pleasure of music, hence our ear get's sweaty after some time (kind of heated feeling). apart from that headset is damn good. it comes with mic, this headset didn't support my mobile so couldn't test mic feature yet, so listening through system.i heard various songs for testing the bass effect and over all effect's as it say's XB. hearing through headset the akon-clap again is always cool. You will not feel disappointed using this except for sweating guess it happens in these type of set's. my view is i dont get satisfied anytime. but this is not disappointing.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Backside of the package mentioned that not all phones are compatible with the mic. I tried to use it for phone calls but the other party could not hear me. Searched everywhere for solution and finally found that there is an Android app from Sony called Smart Connect. After installing and configuring it, my mic works. Wish Sony had given some clarification about this in the user manual provided.2. Mic picks up all background noise, not too useful for official conference calls unless you are in silent place.3. Head band is adjustable, but unless you set it tight - it could slip off at times. When you set it tight, you will feel uncomfortable after 10 minutes. May depend on head size...",4.0 out of 5 stars

2322,"I have been using this since 2 years now. Overall the quality of the headphones is fine. The bass is super punchy. Sound quality is good. However do not expect it to stay in shape for long. After 2 years of sparing use the headband has become loose. Also the gum holding the ear pads has come off and now the inner foam is exposed. This has not really affected its functionality but it looks shabby. I am wondering if the ear cups (cushions) can be replaced. In case someone has any idea do let me know..Update:3 years now and one of the earcups have come off. I took it to the service center just to check if they can replace both the earcups and to my surprise the response I got was really bad. Any damage to the earcup is considered as an accidental damage and even if it is under warranty, it won't be entertained. Mine was anyway out of warranty so I was ready to pay for the replacement but I was told that this is not possible. In fact any issue with the headphones/earphones after the warranty is not Serviceable and this holds true for any range of earphones or headphones you buy from Sony in India.

For listening music and watching anime/webseries/youtube videos, this provides a great sound quality and you won't be disappointed.

2329,"Exit JBL, Exit Bose, Exit Sony - Enter AudioTechnica M30XBefore I start this review, I want to mention that I see a lot of reviews on many websites including Amazon which review a Car and then talk about I) the taste of tyres 2) the smell of the bumper 3) The colour of the chassis. DOES IT MAKE SENSE? Well, if it doesnt please understand that we better talk of build quality, packaging and sound when it comes to a headphone and not about our favourite colour, odour of the box or the thickness of the instruction manual paper.Lets get the basics right. We classify music into:Highs = treble, cymbals (typically 4000-20000Hz)Mids = midrange, female opera singer (350-4000Hz);Lows = bass (20-350 Hz)We also need to assure that the sound quality from the source is the best. This means your old Bollywood songs do not require good headphones and if at all, its a waste of money. Based on these parameters I would rate AudioTechnica for the following songs1) Cypress Hill - Insane in the BrainHighs - NAMids -10/10Lows - 9/10The M30X captures all the details that one might have missed on other headphones. The mids are splendidly captured, again with good details of the lead vocals. The lows are exceedingly satisfactory but neutral. Bassheads need to look elsewhere.2) Edward Maya - Historia de AmorHighs - 10/10Mids -10/10Lows - NAOnce again the M30X captures sounds that one could not hear due to a bad headphone. The highs and mids are a treat to the year. Pure pleasure.3) Radiohead - CreepHighs - 10/10Mids -10/10Lows - 10/10I love this song. Its one of the best songs to test your headphone along with some tracks from Prodigy and many more. The synchronized chord progression is repeated throughout the whole song, alternating between arpeggiated chords in the verses and last chorus, complimented by loud power chords during the first two choruses.The M30X are unbelievably good here. You really fall in love with these headphones.Trust me, these headphones are a league. If at all I would have to recommend a change it would be a better earpad quality and a Bluetooth for the same price. I know I am demanding for a lot more at this price. Having said that, the M30X are the best balanced headphones in this series. The M50X and M40X are typically for studio use and do not fit in much for personal usage unless your ears are paranormal or you are an alien who can listen to abnormal frequencies. The build quality is very good but could have been much, much better to be the best. The accessories (extension chord and leather bag) are really impressive. Just assure that you listen to the best quality of music from the best possible source and see the magic. Highly Recommended + 10/10.",5.0 out of 5 stars
2330,"The sound quality is really good and is comfortable to wear for short durations. They can get uncomfortable after a while.These headphones are not noise cancelling but, more appropriately, should be called noise isolating. They are able to remove most of the background noise (about 70-80%) when playing music.",5.0 out of 5 stars
2331,"I've had these headphones for nearly 5 years now, still haven't seen more than a crack in the leather. Supreme sound quality, excellent noise cancellation and fitting too.However if you are bothered by the aching of your temple and ears after long usage periods and an extremely long wire, I'd recommend going for the ATH-M50x.They're excellent monitor headphones, responds to equaliser changes perfectly and you can hear every detail sitting anywhere. Yet, they're not the best choice to take outdoors and can't be worn around your neck.Overall a positive choice if you're willing to shell out 5.5k",4.0 out of 5 stars

I have previously owned JVC HA – S600, AKG K55, Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro and Skull Candy.So here goes….Pros :Professional build quality.Perfectly balanced.Amazing Soundstage! You can clearly distinguish the different instruments and sound is so CRISP! Was able to hear elements on music which were previously getting lost in low-quality earphones.Decent bass – punchy and complements the overall sound, doesn’t overpower it. Bass heads, you might want to look elsewhere or buy a headphone amp which is another 2k. JVC bass felt so coloured in hindsight.Detailed clarity with outstanding mid-range re-production. Vocal clarity is astounding! It is the best headphones vocalists can use in this price rangeHighs are pretty goodComfortable cans, with well cushioned ear pads.Cons :Impedence of 47 ohms might be a lil less to power these. Please note these are studio headphones and therefore low powered devices may lack the required output.Long wire (Duh! Like you didn’t know it before you bought!)May need to tweak the equalizer for the most optimal sound depending on genre.A wee-bit more focus on mids but not a deal-breaker.Bottomline : One of the best cans in this price rangeWill update the review after the burn in is complete…",4.0 out of 5 stars
2333,"Well, I will make this short. Do you have a budget of five thousand rupees? And do you want to delve into the world of good audio?If your answer is yes to both the questions, buy these headphones without any doubt.They sound marvellous. Now I cannot use another pair of Sony or Skullcandy because these pair make me want more. You get no coloration of your audio. You hear it as it was intended to be heard. No extra bass, but you will get the most minute of details. Comfort is okay. Don't go out running wearing these. Sit, relax and blow away your mind! Durability, let's say rock solid is a good way to describe it. I have literally thrown them around the house.Now for the criticism; nothing is perfect after all. After 20 months of use, over 2500 hours clocked in, the right channel stopped working a month ago. No one is replying to my calls, messages or e-mails. After sales service is non-existent. I am really sad because these headphones were not that cheap, people don't earn what they cost in a month, in our country. But Audio Technica does not feel the need to address this issue.Now, I do not know if your pair will outlast you or get delivered to you broken, but these are the best for the buck.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2334,"This is a really good headphone.Let me start off with the delivery, it arrived on time, was in a bigger package than what I had in mind. The package was a little damaged, though not a lot. The unpacking experience was quite good. Everything was neatly packed and covered. The carry pouch looks like it'll hold for quite a long time. The headphones look fabulous... They could be folded up easily. The 3.5 mm jack was hidden under the bigger one. The cable is really long, too long for travel purposes, so I recommend you tie it up. The earcups cover your ears perfectly and smoothly. Felt very good. I usually get hot ears very fast, but using these, it took longer for my ears to heat up, and it wasn't too hot... The noise isolation is really good. You couldn't hear your own voice at high volumes. Don't use high volumes for long intervals though. With that said, the quality of sound was just pure. The lows, the mids, the highs, everything was so crisp. I heard instruments that I've never heard in songs that I've played thousands of times before. A true professional look and feel to it. It is made out of plastic, but quality is top notch. Certainly something I'd suggest you to buy if you have the money. I of course got it at the discounted rate. It's like the best headphone at this price range. The surround sound effects are heavenly! I don't enjoy too much bass, so this was perfect for me as everything was equally balanced. Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars
2335,I had bought M20X earlier and had been using it for more than a year until my dog chewed up the wire. Which gave me the perfect opportunity to upgrade to M30X.

Which the lower models don’t include.The sound and noise cancellation is perfect for audiophiles.However prolonged used makes my ears sweat and without cleaning and proper maintenance the padding over time can start cracking.

Yes,sound is above average but nothing like mindblowing.For people saying that bass on other headsets is not desirable ,adjusting the equalizer settings can reduce bass and enhance vocals or treble.I have quad DAC support on my phone so most headsets give clear sound that is quite similar to the source.Noise cancellation is quite ordinary.Sound rating : 3.5/52. Comfort:These are not so comfortable in my opinion. The long wire also hinders portability.I can't think of carrying these outside so I use the other earphone whole travelling or walking.Also it feels heavy on the ear after a while.Rating :1.5/53.Build Quality and Value for money.Build quality and design is average.I have used headsets at half the price having better and having an eye catching design.Also the wire can get tangled easily.At 6k,this headphone does not offer value for money.I suppose it is mainly designed for professionals involved in studio recordings.But as a consumer,I would go for a 2-3 k range headset which is more comfortable and has a better design and is more portable over this.Rating: 1.5/5",2.0 out of 5 stars

Though this is slightly more expensive than my previous headphones, they totally justify every rupee spent on it.The make is quite sturdy and I have had no heating problem because of the ear pads. The sound quality is excellent and I love the collapsible design. Takes up less space and looks tidy.

2379,"This is one of the best pair of headphones that I have bought. Excellent sound quality. The only downside is that the ears get uncomfortable after prolonged usage because of the leather material because it traps heat and is not a breathable material.

2382,I did a lot of research before fixing up my mind for ATHM30X. Lets get very straight..Very soothing to ears..could have been a bit loud...bass is very low but crystal clear sound...its big and the major prob is the length of the wire....its too lengthy..not at all appropriate for those planning to listen music on the go..,4.0 out of 5 stars

2405,"I brought these headphones (realme buds 2) after reading so many reviews and some people also mentioned these headphones in reviews of other headphones/earbuds. Hope my review will help some.One thing for sure about these buds, these are not for bass lovers. People love these headphones because they are perfectly tuned and there are no harsh frequencies that give uncomfortable feeling while listening to music or answering a call. I tried applying EQ to decrease high pitch sounds and boost the bass but still these are only decent at bass.Personally I felt little bit pain in ears after applying these buds over 20 30 minutes.Build quality, mic and sound clarity are good in these headphones, at least for now.Overall these headphones are overrated as it depends upon personal preferences. If you need bass then better go for boAt bassheads or a decent all rounder mi dual driver otherwise for casual use and gaming these buds are fine.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2406,I have been using wired earphones from a very long time. I must say that it's damn good. Great quality product. The wires won't be damaged anytime soon if you handle with care. Light weight and kind of fixes perfectly in ear. Good product in this price range. Noise cancellation is just lit🔥,4.0 out of 5 stars
2407,"1.Build Quality even @₹524 is shockingly good and Realme Buds 2 feels so premium (5/5).2.Sound Quality is very good. I already have Sennheiser cx213. So, I can feel that Buds 2 can not produce cx213's 'Pure' sound, but is not much behind(Price of cx213 is ₹1100 now)A. Bass is puchy, tight, esp. lower bass(5/5). Cx213's bass is less tight & punchy, but not much lessB. Mids are so clear(4/5). Cx213's mids are better.C. Highs are supressed a little (3/5), Cx213's highs are far better, but it's highs often hurt ears3.Buds 2 has lots of features like magnetic earbuds,play-pause,volume control,cords are tangle free ,etc..all these add to premium user experience(5/5)4.Voice Clarity during call is very good and sound is rich; noise cancellation is good, not ANC type5.Earbud are very comfortable for music playing for even 3-5 hrs continuously, no painonly drawback is it's jack is not L shaped.I like both, like two little babies;I also have Tagg Sonic Angle 1 Bluetooth speaker.Man,Tagg is like a 'Chhota Bomb', my favoriteand going to buy Obage HT 244 4.1 music system..",4.0 out of 5 stars
2408,Pros: This is actually the audio quality I needed. Perfectly blend bass and treble. Tried using equalizer to enhance the treble and demn! Build quality is gud too with braided cables. Magnetic earcups too is gud. Perfect fit for ears.Cons: They say its tangle-free but the wire of left and right earcups gets tangles maybe its cus its new. The end of the earphone is a straight up connector and prolly there's a chance u gotta disconnect the earphone by pulling its wires which might cause wires to stretch and break.Conclusion: Best value for money earphone I have ever bought,4.0 out of 5 stars
2409,"I bought these earphones mostly for sake of having flexibility of wired ones. I have realme airbuds 3 neo too and they sound fantastic as compared to these but these are fine. I mean it says 11.2 mm bass boost driver and all but it rolls off quickly below 40hz. It just mid-bass boosted. Welp, having such a huge driver does affect high frequency and it is quite evident when listening to songs. I have attached an image of poweramp equalizer setting to make it sound most balanced( of course you can tune it the way you like). I've had earphones costing double ,tripple the amount (sony mh something and Sennheiser cx 213) and they were really off with harsh peaks but had better details. This one is just a bit more bàlanced with no harsh peaks but with less detailing. Mic is also fine. So far a good daily beater.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2410,No doubt Product is so good but whenever I receive my first product from Amazon it is always defected peace. customer executive are talking in the very badly and they not give me replacement at the end the issue is solved but not with costomer care but with Amazon app. be aware of used product .,4.0 out of 5 stars
2411,Been using it for a year now. Works perfectly fine. No complaints as far except that you could have worked better on the design. The pause/play button is too inward and difficult to press. It could have been more bulged out so that you dont need long nails to press it. Good product overall.,4.0 out of 5 stars

And it works so well, the sounds are great.Maybe it is new product thing or mine was defective but at the end it works.I will probably update the review after some time using the earphone.It is 5 star worthy but because of initial bad experience I rate it 4 stars.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I washed them in washing machine (by mistake obviously), used them as cowboy rope, threw them on my friend to hit him, did rain dance wearing them for more than a minute, and don't know what else. But this hell of an earphones didn't stop to surprise me. It seems they're not going to stop any soon. It's been almost 1year and 364 days...tomorrow I'm going to celebrate its birthday 🎂🤣. Jokes aside they're absolutely amazing in terms of sound, can be used for binge watching, for listening to long-hours podcasts and endless music. They're also loud and with good amount of bass....because of it I never used them on full volume, hardly 70-80% is enough for me. The magnet in this earphones are good to make them stick around your nack, the cable organiser is very much useful...as they don't have flat tangle-free wires.Overall I have no other words to explain how good they're, if you think i praised them too much go for it, test them yourself.",5.0 out of 5 stars

2503,"I'm absolutely in love with these headphones. I decided to switch to over ear headphones since earbuds just don't fit properly in my ears and feel like they'll fall off any second. I've been using these non-stop for the past 2 months now and they're still working as new. I'm a very reckless user so the fact that there's not even a single scratch on them is amazing. The sound quality is great compared to the shitty stuff I've been using before.One drawback is that it gets loose very fast. It does get a bit annoying since I always keep my hair open and it sometimes slides here and there, almost slipping off my head if I look down for too long. A quick fix is to tie a rubber band around it overnight so it fits nice and snug in the morning. I also wish there was more emphasis on the bass but you can just tweak the equaliser on the app and it's all good.One more thing is that I wish these were noise cancelling. I use public transport, so I have to use a volume booster because of how loud the background noise gets.Lookswise, It looks very sleek and modern which goes with all outfits.If you're on a budget and you want a good quality pair of headphones that look good as well, these are the best ones!!",5.0 out of 5 stars

2510,"I have been using this product for months. So recently when i used another Sony Headphones namely XM5, for me personally the difference wasn't huge in terms of the quality of sound. Surely there were ton of more features. And they seem premium as well. But specifically when i refer to the music, the difference is not that big. I like the fact they still maintain quality of sound even in cheaper products. I do gaming and music both, and in both XM5 is better, but these do a pretty good job at both.

The dual device pairing feature is incredibly convenient, switching seamlessly between my phone and laptop. Voice assist and Type-C fast charging are like icing on the cake.Being IPX4 water-resistant, they've survived my intense workouts without a hiccup.

2634,"I've been using these headphones for a few days now, and while I have some mixed feelings about them. On the positive side, the sound quality is great - the bass is deep and rumbly, and the mids and highs are clear and detailed. I also appreciate the convenience of wireless connectivity, and the fact that the headphones can charge quickly in the charging case.However, there are a few things that are a bit disappointing. Firstly, the fit isn't the most comfortable - the earbuds tend to shift around in my ears, which can be a bit annoying. Secondly, the battery life could be better - I find myself having to recharge the headphones more often than I'd like. And finally, the price is a bit steep - I feel like I could get similar quality headphones for less money from other brands.Overall, I'd say these headphones are good but not great. They deliver on sound quality and convenience, but fall short in terms of comfort and value for money.

But I was expected that, this buds give me beautiful dolby atmos, but it gives only bass not clarity or not dolby atmos, and this buds is not good for calling purposes because of it's mic. This buds are only for bass lovers not for dolby sound lovers. It's bass level is very high & clarity is very low. So friends my suggestion is that, who wants to buy a dolby atmos buds not bass booster they have to choose any another brand. Thank You. 🙏🏻",3.0 out of 5 stars

All kinds of things happen to the media -pause, next track, poweroff etc- when we try to adjust them. This is more problematic when you're in an office Teams call, and the call just hangs up because you tried to adjust the earbuds.Other than those 2 issues, I guess the earbuds are okay.",4.0 out of 5 stars

2726," I recently got my hands on the Ptron Bassbuds, and I must say, they have been quite a pleasant surprise. As a budget-conscious consumer, I was initially skeptical about their performance, but after putting them to the test, I'm impressed with what they offer for the price.Sound Quality: The standout feature of the Ptron Bassbuds is their audio quality. The bass response is punchy and powerful, as the name suggests. For bass enthusiasts, these earbuds won't disappoint. However, the bass isn't overpowering and still maintains a good balance with the mids and highs. The overall sound signature leans towards warmth, which makes them ideal for genres like pop, hip-hop, and electronic music.Design and Comfort: The design of the Ptron Bassbuds is sleek and compact, with a glossy finish that gives them a premium appearance. The earbuds fit snugly in my ears and come with multiple ear tip sizes, ensuring a comfortable fit for extended use. I appreciate the inclusion of touch controls, which are intuitive and responsive for managing playback, volume, and calls without reaching for my device.Battery Life: The battery life on the Ptron Bassbuds is quite impressive. On a full charge, I was able to get around 4.5 to 5 hours of continuous playback, and the charging case provided an additional 20 hours, which is more than enough for my daily needs. The USB Type-C charging port is a welcomed addition for quicker and hassle-free charging.Connectivity: Pairing the Bassbuds with my smartphone was effortless, and they maintained a stable connection with minimal dropouts during use.Call Quality: While the sound quality for music playback is excellent, the call quality on the Ptron Bassbuds is average. Callers on the other end reported my voice to be slightly muffled, and the built-in microphone didn't provide the best noise isolation in noisy environments.Final Thoughts: The Ptron Bassbuds offer exceptional value for money, providing an impressive audio experience at a budget-friendly price point. They excel in bass reproduction, making them a great choice for bass lovers. The design, comfort, and battery life are commendable, and the inclusion of touch controls is a definite plus. While the call quality could be improved, it's not a deal-breaker considering the overall package.If you're on a budget and seeking a pair of wireless earbuds that deliver on sound performance and functionality, the Ptron Bassbuds are an excellent choice",5.0 out of 5 stars

The environmental noise cancellation performs admirably, striking a great balance. Not to mention the solid build quality that's equally impressive. Charging is a breeze – just 25-30 minutes take the battery from 0 to 90%, and the 6-8 hours of playback time, along with 6 additional charges from the case, are fantastic for the price point.

2782,Right now I'm using this earbuds for around 20 days and the sound is very satisfactory. The bass and treble is quite clear and I think the sound quality is really good for the price. But there's only one single flaw in this device which is the latency. While gaming I almost hear sounds after like 55ms which is apparently equivalent to 1 second almost. The packaging says they provide a latency of 40 ms but it's not even close to 40. Hence the earbuds is a big no no for multiplayer games where sound is a key factor. Overall the conclusion is phantom 700 is good for music and casual gaming.,4.0 out of 5 stars

Look for earbuds with high-quality drivers and possibly support for advanced audio codecs like AAC and aptX for improved wireless audio quality.Comfort and Fit: Comfortable earbuds are essential, especially if you plan to use them for extended periods. Look for models that come with different ear tip sizes or ear wings to ensure a secure and snug fit for your ears.Battery Life: Long battery life is crucial for uninterrupted listening. Look for earbuds that offer several hours of playback on a single charge, and a case that provides extra charges on the go.Connectivity: For wireless earbuds, consider the Bluetooth version and its range. Bluetooth 5.2 is preferable for better connectivity and stability.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2793,"Reviewing aft 2month of using...PROS:Customization: With app support, you can customize the earbuds' sound profile according to your preferences. The app may provide an equalizer or preset sound settings, allowing you to tailor the audio experience to your liking.Battery Status and Health Monitoring: The app can display the remaining battery life of each earbudBattery backup is very good, transparent earbuds looks beautiful.Everything perfect but .CONS:In 2month my right earbud cap came out 2 times , not even fall down. ( my cousin also brought this buds he also face this problem) soWhen it happens first time me & my cousin tried to contact customer support team via Instagram messages nd mail .

2818,"After almost 3 weeks of usage, it feels value for money. Battery backup is fine for my usage. Sound quality is also very good at this price range. App support and Noise Cancellation mode is very much appreciated. One thing to keep in mind is that the case and buds itself felt very premium when I bought it. But both will get scratched very easily. We have to be extra careful while handling it. But to be fair we cannot expect much more in this price range. I'm happy with the product as of now. Will update if anything goes wrong.UPDATE:I faced some issue regarding the spontaneous activation of google assistant and followed by a shutdown of my earbuds. Don't know what caused the issue. I kept my buds aside and not used it for few weeks and the issue is now solved. Meanwhile, I raised request for replacement under warranty, and they responded to the mails I have sent. And pickup was scheduled. But no one contacted me for pickup. So now I am using the same buds which I received for the first time. Also app is not detecting that my earbuds are connected, most of the time. Even though I'm listening music through the buds. Not sure whether it's my phone issue or buds issue.",4.0 out of 5 stars

2879,"This will be a little long review, you can scroll down for my conclusion on this product.Note - Ive talked about Rockerz Trinity below this.Giving context -I've been an avid user of ""Boat Rockerz 255 Pro +"" (the one i was using before this, was purchased on 12 August 2021).On an average it used to last me 3ish days before i needed to charge it, my use was, Full volume or 80% volume, an average of 10 hours a day use.My experience with boat products in general has been extremely positive including their post sales service if you product suffers some manufacturing defect and is within the warranty period.Upon looking into reviews for trinity and it's claimed battery life i kind of went in with closed eyes. (Yes there is a risk of the product malfunctioning sometimes, but then the best of them have this risk.)So my experience in comparison to me previous earphone is as follows.#Sound quality -- The Signature sound mode is the same that you get on rockerz 255 pro +, BUT more Bass (always a welcoming change).-(5/5)- Vocals and other sounds in general a clear and crisp (If your music distorts at high volumes, you might wanna consider getting a better file, Flac is always better than Mp3, just saying.) (5/5)- As for the balanced mode, it was ""Meh"" at best for me, maybe others mind find it useful, it's more of a personal preference, but less bass is a no no for me. (3.5/5)#Battery life-- The claim is of 150 hours, but i got an effective life of 70ish hours. (4/5)- For context, i started using trinity out of the box when i got it on 23rd of July, and charged it in the evening of 29th. As a student a good 10 hours a day use, at minimum, with volume at 70% and occasionally 100% (Do note, 150hours is rated for 60% volume.)- I got to the 70 hours mark along with using Dual pairing (my tablet and phone)- ASAP charge give the charging times as you'd expect, approx 45 mins for 20% to 100% (100% as in when the charging light turns off)-Type C charging is seen.#Comfort and Fit--In comparison to my old earphones, these are a better fit, probably because of a higher quality plastic and smooth edges.(4.5/5)-As for the buds, you can choose what fits you since 3 types are available overall.-Also the magnetic earbuds seem to be stronger and yet not too strong to be a hassle. (4.5/5)#Call Quality and connectivity- As per my family and friends my voice was more clear and crisp in comparison to my old earphones, so this is a Win for me.(5/5)#Gaming Mode (Beast Mode)- Honestly in my opinion all bluetooth earphones are inferior to wired earphones, but as far as Bluetooth earphones go, the latency of 65ms is justified, for the price point this is good. (3.5/5)#Volume and power rockers-- The buttons on this are good, id say even better than my previous earphones and the material is premium feeling. (5/5)#Conclusion -When i had purchased my Boat Rockerz 255 pro + they are at the same price point of Trinity. So it's like buying the same earphones with a massive upgrade to sound and battery.In my opinion, for a price of 1499, they are an easy buy. And with boat's reputation, the post sales service is as good as it gets.",5.0 out of 5 stars
2880,"I have purchased this headphones just after its release, that means before writing this review i get to use this headphones for almost a month now.So after a month of experience here it is...1. Battery:As expected amazing battery, they showcase 150hrs, but after using it daily for atleast 7 to 8 hrs and on sat and sun 10 to 12 hrs my battery backup has been amazing. This headphones go for almost 2 weeks without charge. So I'd say this headphones can give you atleast 90 to 100hr of backup.2 sound quality:I am a sound enthusiast so for me having atleast a nice sound for cheap headphones is a must, and i must say that this headphones have not disappointed me, their signature sound mode is what i use daily, as the balanced mode is just awefull.Also the noise cancellation is ZERO so dont expect anything.3. Built quality:Material is plastic, the earbuds, the button board everything here is plastic, not expecting this last more than a year if used daily.4. Length:This is a lengthy neckband, image having 1.5m cable and making a necband out of it. This is what this headphones are, and because of that the are not going sit tight on your neck they will be loose and often times, will be irritating as they will be just falling.Conclusion:Overall good headphones with decent quality, as i like to have good battery so this one are definitely for me and with this price range i do recommend this one. Only the issue is the length of the neckband, and the plastic quality of it could be improved.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2881,If you are a music lover and very particular about low / mid / high then this is not the good one. I mainly bought this for official meetings and video conferencing.

2883,"The sound quality is good. But noise cancellation is not at all there. One more problem is the neckband when it touches my bare skin it have a very odd feeling and is sweating in that place. Because of this, wearing this neckband when I wear collar-less shirts are not possible. Also when the battery power goes below 50% the mic quality also goes bad. i.e. people in other side will not be able to hear us properly. The battery stays for a week for my usage, but still when the battery power goes below 50%, I shall keep it for charging.",3.0 out of 5 stars
2884,"Its a good product with good sound quality. Fast connecting Bluetooth, good noise cancellation. Battery can go upto a month on daily approx 1hr of usage.

Supports aac, battery for me last 5 to 6 days with at least 4 hours of zoom calls every day and 3 hours of media consumption every day at 60% vlomime (that's pretty loud too).

2895,Nice and very good,4.0 out of 5 stars
2896,It has 10mm Drivers which even fired up at full volume are bit quiet and I don't use 30-40% of my other earphones. A slightly better battery and below average drivers make it last a week or two without charging. My sole purpose of this earphones was to use under my helmet which they did quite comfortably. But when cruising around at 120-130 the wire noise it makes is way too much. I only use neckband on bike because it has music and call controls which I can access over my helmet. Otherwise I would go for TWS in same price range for daily use and wired earphones for gaming purpose as the latency on this is way higher even in Beast Mode. The balanced mode on this earphones is quite nice for watching videos and all. Still I would prefer much larger drivers on such chunky neckbands.,3.0 out of 5 stars

2939,"There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2940,"Pros:• Sound signature & quality is very good.• Bass, Treble, Lows-Highs-Mids are also very good, you can hear every instrument in the music properly.• Build quality is also very good.• Battery life is amazing. And battery charging is also very fast.• Latency & range is also very good.Cons:• No Dual Pairing.• ANC is missing.• Call Pick - Call Drop Button (Main Button) which also used as Play-Pause Button placement is inconvenient. You'll have inconvenience finding the button everytime you're doing something.• Because they are very lightweight, when you ride bike over 60-70 kmph they starts floating (it's subjective).• Cords which are attached to the neck frame, those cords are slightly short. If you have a long neck (like me) you'll feel this problem.Conclusion:Must recommend for music lovers. They should have included ANC, Dual Pairing and made them slightly more heavier. Otherwise they are great to go.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2941,"It's been a year since I have been in the OnePlus environment, I was using Z2 last year and these earphones have just a 200 rupee price difference but I will say it is worth it, the reason being they do have a dual mic so another person is able to listen to me.Moreover, I found the sound quality better for this one along with noise cancellation.If you are looking for budgeted Oneplus earphones I recommend you to have this one with ANC, instead of having a normal Z2 with AI cancellation.Also if I'll talk about colour option, do not experiment and have black for yourself",4.0 out of 5 stars
2942,- Everything is almost similar to old version- ANC is Okayish- Quick switch - Good- Hey melody app support now you can have software updates on this.** Issues- Quick switch doesn't work sometimes while it works seamlessly with version Z1- Sometimes doesn't connect to same device when you turn if off and connect again.,4.0 out of 5 stars
2943," Previously i was using one plus wirless z and they were fitting me well but now I ordered this because i was happy with the previous version of it but this one is not fitting me well ,i tried all the ear plugs but they are easily coming off even when i am moving little bit my main purpose was for working out but forget about workout even if i am walking or moving my neck slightly they are coming off i am unhappy with this product because of this and i also called amazon for this but they cannot help me according to their policy and i am helpless here because cannot use the product so guys please check how they fit in your ears before buying",4.0 out of 5 stars
2944,"So, here's my review.Pros:-1. The design and build quality is sturdy and nice.2. Sound quality is good, you won't have any bad sound quality even in maximum volume.3. Battery backup is good too(in my usage the battery lasts for 20hrs atleast, i listen to music, stay on call sometimes at lower volume until 70% volume.).4. The fast charging is a game changer here, I'm a quite busy person and i have no time to wait for my phone to even get charge sometimes, and here this neckband dominates, it charges within 15-20mins from 0-100%.5. Bass is also good.Cons:-1. The main con i found here is the latency. If you play games like PUBG or COD type games competitively then it might not be the ideal option gor you because the ping is really detectable (difference between when you shoot the bullet and when you hear sound) it's around 90-100ms. So i will not recommend it for gaming.Overall, I'm satisfied with what i bought, this product is worth of buying if you're a office worker or something then go for it. You can enjoy the high quality sound and stable connection.If you're a gamer then i would recommend for something else. I'm not really into games that much and also, i have a different headphone which is good for gaming stuff.Sorry for writing a long review and thank you for reading.",4.0 out of 5 stars

3039,"Sound quality - Perfect who love balanced sound. Base lovers will also like it as it has that BOOM base. Perfect to listen to all kind of music. If base is needed, tune the equalizer in JBL app. I like to listen to music in nuetral sound and watch movies, so no tuning needed for those.Stand out feature is Battery life. Got these on Wednesday.. listened to music, watching youtube videos and movies for 2-3 hours daily and after 4 days, battery life is at 80-90 %. Once charged, I think these headphones will last for weeks. (atleast a week on heavy usage and ANC on)Noise cancellation is not good. With ANC on, you still are able to hear outside noise when music is not playing. With normal music or movies playing, ANC works fine, you are dont hear anything from outside. Talk Through feature works great.CON: Wearing comfort is not good or as expected. After 30 mins or so, ears start to heat and sweat. If you live in warm climate, it will feel uncomfortable to wear after some time. If you have AC on in the room, then it does not matter or just remove the headphones for a min after sometime, and it should be fine. The earpads should have had some air circulation.I like JBL sound tuning and have multiple earphones and sound bar all from JBL.

3043,"Been a genuine fan of JBL when it comes to audio. There weren’t many reviews when I bought it so here’s my take -There’s just one con: the multiport connectivity is a joke. Its pretty much useless since I have to on and off Bluetooth to switch devices.The good stuff-I’m an audiophile on a budget and this fits perfectly for my needs. The audio is amazing, EQ customisation in the app is great. Super soft and easy on the ears and head. I wear them for long hours and didn’t feel any pain or discomfort (which happens with headphones in general). Sweat, might be an issue and honestly it’s just because of global warming. I have a Sony On the ear headphones (wired) and it made me sweat a lot - super annoying. But haven’t faced that with this one! There’s huge difference in the audio quality between JBL and boAt. BoAt audio sounds super cheap compared to JBL. Battery life is a beast on this one. You don’t have to think twice. I also use it for making my music and it does it really well!So if you need a headphones for long hours and great audio/call quality and damn good bass, go for it.ANC is decent. Fan and people talking in the same room gets reduced but not cancelled entirely. It’s Adaptive NC not Active NC.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Dual pairing feature is awesome. Seemless connectivity. Battery life seems to be very good.Negatives : (Only 1 but an important one for me as I wanted a headphones to be used for several hours every day). Firstly when I used them I was focusing on the sound quality which is really good but I started feeling some discomfort on my ears after playing 2-3 songs. I found this headphones to be very uncomfortable when using it for more than 15mins my ears started paining not because of the sound but the way it fits on my ears (I tried adjusting the size/fit and different settings. My ears are average sized infact slightly on the smaller side).These are supposed to cover the whole ear as these are over-ear headphones. But instead its more like on-ear headphones as the cushions are not that big in size.",2.0 out of 5 stars

3069,"Writing this review after 2 days of usage:Audio/Music: If you are like me and love clear vocals and crisp music then these headphones are for you. Not for bass lovers.Call clarity is very good. The other side didn’t hear any background noise and I could hear their voice very clearly. Call clarity when connected to the aux is fine as well. No issues in attending phone calls wireless and wired.Note 1: For multiplayer gaming I connect the headphones using the aux cable but the other players are not able to hear me clearly. Wirelessly you won’t be able to hear the sounds (I tested CS:GO). In single player games, the headphone supports both wireless and wired connections.Note 2: Microsoft Teams and Skype do not support these headphones. So unfortunately you have to wear your earphones to attend office calls if Microsoft teams and Skype is being used.Note 3: No audio delay on YouTube. (Tested both wireless and wired connections)Comfort: Even with my glasses on I experienced no discomfort whatsoever and the cushions are so soft I had no issues wearing these for 3-4 hours on a stretch (if your glasses have thick frames then maybe you have to adjust quite a bit but my thin wayfarer frame causes no trouble). Cushions look durable as well. Care to be taken if you are wearing these with your room temperature more than 34-35 degrees as your ears may get very warm (warm ears are not a problem it is just more of an annoyance) and also sweat will be soaked by cushions which in long-term could make you to replace cushions within a year or 14 months.Build: All plastic with matte finish. Build to last it seems but don’t overstretch them as plastic is plastic. Look wise they give a premium-minimalist look.The aux cable is 1.2m long but its build quality is not very good. I fear it will break if somehow it manages to get stuck on a chair arm or some other place so take care.The charging cable is micro usb (no usb type c unfortunately even when this headphone launched in year 2020 ) but charging time is super low: 2hrs for a full charge with a fast charging adapter and ~2.5hrs if connected to a laptop usb port although the charging cable is very short.The headband is cushioned so it does not hurt the top of my head even after wearing the headphones for hours.",4.0 out of 5 stars

3081,"I recently purchased the JBL Tune 760NC headphones and have been using them for a few weeks now. Overall, I'm impressed with the sound quality and noise-cancelling capabilities of these headphones, but there are a few drawbacks to consider.Advantages:The noise-cancelling technology on these headphones is excellent. They block out a significant amount of external noise, making them perfect for use in noisy environments like airplanes or busy offices. The sound quality is also fantastic, with clear highs, mids, and lows. The bass is especially impressive, providing a satisfying thump without overpowering the rest of the music.The headphones are also comfortable to wear for extended periods. The ear cups are soft and cushioned, and the headband is adjustable to fit a wide range of head sizes. The battery life is impressive as well, lasting around 35 hours on a single charge with ANC turned on.Disadvantages:One of the main drawbacks of these headphones is that they're quite bulky. They take up a lot of space in a bag or backpack, making them less than ideal for travel.Another thing to note is that the headphones don't come with a carrying case, which is a bit of a letdown considering their size. You'll need to purchase a separate case if you want to protect them while traveling.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase of the JBL Tune 760NC headphones. While they have a few drawbacks, their excellent noise-cancelling and sound quality make them a great choice for anyone looking for a high-quality pair of headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars

First off all it has no customizations from the JBL app. The max volume focuses more on the vocals which are terribly handled. 130% volume is best because at that time you can feel the richness in sounds but the speakers are not that powerful and there's always a feeling of a missing feeling from these. The build quality can be improved. The 2 device connectivity feature works good. The ANC is not good. It doesn't cut the sound and makes a major difference. I wished more but it couldn't deliver.

NOT AT ALL. If i have to rate the bass out of 10 i would rate it 3. 3 too because at least i get to know that there is bass in the song. Cant believe this headphones cost almost 5K rupees. Also it has NO IP rating. So prone to water damage is high. Along with it, i used Zebronics Headphones too which was less than 1K rupees and the music experience was waaaaaay better than these JBL ones. I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THESE HEADPHONES AND JBL brand.VOLUME IS VERY LOW...even at 100% you wont feel any bass, however other things like treble vocals are not disturbed even at 100% volume but it feels dry with no bass....ironically the name is PURE BASS HEADPHONE.......i dont know how....i will rate this headphones as follows-1.

3106,"I have been using the headphones (TUNE 760) for more than a month, here is my reviewAt first (2 days of purchasing) I was very disappointed because I felt that the sound quality was very lacking, the base and loudness disappointed me, but after a week, it started to sound very very good, I think it needed a burn period, because this headphone is now sounding very very good for me.Build Quality - the build quality is good, no major issues, the pad is soft.Comfort - the headphone is comfortable, but one issue is that the clamping force is a bit tight, maybe because I have a big head. Another thing is, even though this is an over read headphone it is not that big, so some part of my ear gets a bit uncomfortable after long use, but if u adjust and find the correct comfortable position, you cab wear it for a long time, I watched a 3 hr movie without any issuesBattery - omg, one of the best part of this headphone, claims 50 hr without noise cancellation, I think it lives upto the mark. You don't have to worry about batterySound quality - I'm not an audiophile, let me clear it up. The sound quality I felt was really good and I was very impressed, after the burn in period, so if you are buying this give it at least 1 week before judging it, trust me it really really gets better. The base was not that high, but not lacking also, was upto the mark.Noise cancellation - it wasn't really that great, could slightly reduce the fan noise that's it, I wouldn't say it is useless, but not that bad either, could reduce the noise of tv from next room when I listened to music, so it did came in handy also with noise cancellation the sound quality I felt improved a bit.Conclusion - as I said, I was really disappointed at first with the purchase, thought I wasted the money(6.5k) but now I'm really really enjoyed it, watching movies was the best experience with dolby music profile in my phone. I'd say it is really worth the money if ur looking for a headphone around 7k",4.0 out of 5 stars

3111,"Using this product for 2 weeks. It's a 4.5 star product but not 5 star due to following reasons. I listen to music a lot, watch movies and also plays a lot of games. My experience is given below.Cons.1. Ear comfort ( 4.5 stars )- Although the product is extremely comfortable I have large ears so a little pain is there if I use it for prolonged periods (2 hour +). People with small to medium ear size may not have any problem with this. I will have to remove for a few minutes and then I can continue. The ear cushions are really soft and the comfort is so far the best.2. Adding to the above point - if you are living in a relatively hot area, ears might sweat and may become uncomfortable. My place is 30+ degree Celsius always. In cooler climate the issue is not existing.3. Audio quality is excellent but really minimal buzzing is there for deep bass. This will not be noticeable at all if you are playing music or gaming. For music and audio editing this may be an issue. Not sure if this is only there for my product. I am satisfied with the product so not returning it.4. No next or prev buttons.Pros.1. Extremely long battery life and quick charging. I have been using the product for 4 days without recharging and is a huge plus. Not tested how many hours I get with ANC on but is pretty long. I use the headsets for 5-6 hours daily and is really good. Charging is pretty quick too.2. ANC is really good. While I was traveling it was able to filter most of the traffic noice except really loud noises. People chatting and other noice is not at all audible so Mom might get angry ;)3. Latency is really low. I was able to play pubg mobile with this and latency was almost undetected but it is there.4. Audio quality is superb, bass is pretty good and is the best so far5.

3117,"If you wanna get this for the noise cancellation feature, you might be disappointed. It isolates at the most 60-70% of the noise around. High frequencies, it does not isolate them at all. I mean zero. You'll be able to hear women's voices, car horns, and anything that is high pitched.Coming to the audio itself, absolutely disappointing. This does not sound like a JBL at all. I've had JBL & Infinity products in the past, and their sound is way better to this. Heck, even my Infinity headphones worth 2k sound better than this.And it's not even comfortable on your ears. Not at all.The only good thing about this is the separation of instruments. Absolutely crisp.Every single instrument and every single note is really clear and really crispy.

3118,"These headphones are a little disorienting, and I can explain. I was a bit skeptical on what the ANC would be like on budget headphones. And I was right.The first thing I noticed when I tried these on was the kind of seal around the ears. It creates this vacuum-like effect where it feels like all the air in and around your ears have been sucked out, which could be good for the noise cancelling, but definitely feels strange. And then there is the active noise cancelling itself, which when you turn on, it kind of shuts out the world around you, but only a little bit. It doesn't cancel white noise, it just makes it quieter. I was still able to hear the fan in my room, and my fan is not noisy in the first place. The ANC was a disappointment and made me feel uncomfortable after a while.The sound quality on the other hand, is good. I have used some JBL headphones like the JBL Quantum 600, and these have a sound that is similar to those headphones. It's a typical JBL sound, where there is slightly more emphasis to the bass and treble, but the mids are not completely crushed. So it sounds like the entire range has been amplified. It's a good sound for people who like the presence of good bass, but don't want too much bass.Battery life has been good so far. Do note that these don't come with a carrying case, but the headphones can be folded. They charge via USB-C, they have an audio jack and come with a cable.Overall, these sound good. I just wish the ANC was better.",3.0 out of 5 stars

3123,"After slight over a year of using these headphones, here's what I have learntPros- Battery lasts a decent amount- Looks niceCons- The Noise cancellation cannot be called that. It does nothing- The cushioning is 3/4 peeled off and has not option to remove the padding/cover of padding- Not very comfortable-If by chance it is connected to 2 Bluetooth devices at one time the sound suddenly goes offIn all honestly if your budget permits, go for something better.",3.0 out of 5 stars
3124,"Noise cancellation and sound quality is good. As expected from JBL. However, the cover material is poor and after 1 year of use, the top layer is coming out and the headphones look really bad.

So, I can no longer use these headphones in public as they look so bad. Will have to buy new ones.",5.0 out of 5 stars

3130,"This is a first impression review, i could give it a better or weaker review later.as soon as I got my hands on the device, I was impressed by the finish, it looks like it could last a while before wear starts to show, the driver cups are really free and allow for various positions, though they are a bit stiff, compared to the ones I was using.Now for the sound.oddly its got 2 sound modes.......let me elaborateWhen you turn on the headphones for the first time, ANC will be on by default (canceled the sound of the ac and the fans completely )in this mode, the bass is quite good but not overwhelming (if you are a bass head, look for something else, trust me)but if you turn the ANC off, the bass take as nose dive and lands with a bellyflop. It seems to take a step back, and everything is more ""open""and on the note of ANC, if you pass 80% volume with ANC on and playing music, the ANC will automatically disable itself and the light will stay on. you will have to turn off the headphones and turn them back on to get the ANC back ......weirdTHIS IS BY NO MEANS BAD THOUGH ......if .....you are not a complete bass head and dont only seek bass (if you want bass more than everything else ......get skull candy crushers)the mids and treble are maintained even if the ANC is off or onPairing is way too easy, its on my PC and phone, but the dual pairing has its fair bit of delay between switching the output (I haven't found the hang of it yet)",4.0 out of 5 stars

I use mostly for webex calls.Battery lasts nearly 4 to 5 days for me.Super fast Bluetooth connection. The moment I turn on headset, it gets connected with one of my paired device seemlesslyCons:1. Would be nice, if I have an option to turn off ANC permanently. Everytime I turn on the headphone, ANC also gets turned on. It would be nice, if it remembers that I had it turned off previously.2. No JBL App support. No configuration possible.3. It would be nice, if it gets turned off automatically. If not connected to any device. I feel battery will last more, if it turns off automatically, if not being used. I had Boat rockerzz previously, it turns off automatically.

3132,"The JBL Tune 760NC showcases an impressive build quality, receiving a perfect score of 5/5. Its durable construction instills confidence in its longevity. However, the active noise cancellation (ANC) disappoints with a subpar 2/5 rating, failing to effectively block out external disturbances. The bass, at 2.5/5, lacks the depth and punch expected for an immersive audio experience. The overall sound quality also falls short at 2.5/5, indicating a lack of balance and nuance. While the sturdy build is commendable, the 760NC's weaknesses in ANC, bass, and sound quality make it difficult to recommend, especially when better alternatives exist within the same category.",2.0 out of 5 stars

3134,"Best entry level NC headset with better sound quality. NC is not that good but cancels subtle noises and turn down down other noises. People talking are not canceled, only muted down. Sound is good for the price range(4/5). If you are looking for superior NC, try to buy sony xm4s wheb there is an offer which is my next headset to buy. The cushions are far too small to fully cover ear, they kinda rests on ur ear edges which is kinda painful over long usage. There was no sweating issue since the headphone has air holes and provide air circulation to ears. Charging time was around 1 hour. Battery life is so perfect, like u can charge this full and use it for a while week without NC with around 5to6 hrs of daily usage. So final verdict is bang for the bucks. If u r into NC, just go buy xm4s... 🏃",4.0 out of 5 stars
3135,"The headphones looks beautiful & fits comfortably on the head esp with the cushion on top of the handle.I received a defective headphone as the battery wasn't charging to 100% even after 2+hrs of charging. Used different USB charger to test. The service centre acknowledged that it was indeed defective after testing it for half-an-hour. Ordered a full replacement. Received within a week.The headphone noise cancelling feature is poor and doesn't even cover basic background noise.

I don't feel like this headphones were an upgrade.. they are very uncomfortable.. I have to remove them after 30 minutes of use to relieve pressure. Sound quality is good. Anc is average. But what's the point if I can't wear them.. they are not fully foldable but not too difficult for travel. Hope I have helped someone from wasting 5k.. I surely regret getting this product.

3141,"I was in the market for a good cheap NC headphones. Obviously the dream was Sony XM4, but those were a little out of budget. So I went on the market, searching for HOURS, company after company, model after model, and I ended up here. And I must say I wasn’t disappointed. Now I’ve tried other NC headphones before, but the top of the line ones like Bose Quite or Apple AirPod max and these aren’t comparable to them at all ofc. I mean to be fair they are literally 1/5th the price. But they aren’t bad.Talking about the noise cancellation, it’s nice but definitely doesn’t cancel all the sounds. The low pitched background noises that you hear in Indian senators, does a good job at masking that, I will give you that much, put high pitched non repetitive sounds like birds chirping or people talking, that you can definitely figure out. This I’m talking with the ANC on and the music off but as soon as the music turns on, Everything disappears, so that’s great. I was just a tad dissapointed cause I bought this so I can use it in trains and planes with loud noise and it does substantially decrease the sound but doesn’t cancel it fullyBut THE BEST part about these headphones? The battery. Just spectacular. I have been using these for the last 10 days and lemme tell you, they came with 75% battery and I haven’t used them since. Just amazing. Now let’s see how long do they hold up and their durability only time will tell, which I will update for sure, but till them, I would definitely definitely recommend them.",4.0 out of 5 stars
3142,"If you are throwing just in the name of JBL then please atleast don't go for this. Increr your budget and buy premium one. Because the type of experience this particular headt is just an average. I think 2-3k priced headphones can also give this kind of experience. The sound quality is good. But there is some kind of weirdnes i notice. When you listen to music without ANC then there will no bass at all. When you hear it a ANC you will find some base. But when you maximize the volume then bass will go away. And in my case at full or 90% sound level with my equilizer onn, the sounds tears apart like some cheap roadside headphones. Battery life is so far is v good. With aux cable also same kind experience you get. This headphones is not loud. Because it can't handle loud sound. The sound become dull and start tearing.

Can connect to 2 devices at a time.Even though 710bt does not have ANC , I like them, there isn't much you can hear after you play a song,The Bass is cool , not too high not too low , there's a lot of clarity in the music , plus with dolby atmos in the phone , I'm having a pretty great experience.Its not tight on the head to me for like atleast maybe 4-5 hrs , but if you wear it longgg enough , yea you'll want to adjust it or remove it completely, but I feel that's pretty much with every headphone right?Just for reference I watched the entire first season of stranger things without removing them once or getting bothered.Umm it bothers a little when you wear it down on the neck cause it is foldable , but i think i figured out something, you can wear the right side on the left one and fold them inside out,Hope all of this helps.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Bluetooth audio delay is 100 milliseconds, a bother while playing the dinosaur game on Chrome (it makes me nauseous when the jump doesn't time with the sound effects). So, make sure to make the headphones wired before attempting to play. Microphone sound is... who cares. You'll forget about all the problems when you'll play your favorite song for the first time.

3246,Okay,3.0 out of 5 stars
3247,Pros:1) The Sound quality and bass it good.2) Since it's a over the ear headphone it feels comfortable around the ear.3) The battery life is good and without ANC mode it comes around 70 hrs.4) Fast charging.5) The ear and head pads are comfortable... I don't feel pain even though wearing them for a long time.6) ANC mode is pretty decent... It does suppress the background noise.7) Dual pairing device.Cons:1) The product is completely made of plastic so don't know the life durability.2) The control buttons are bit harder.3) In dual pairing... I don't know for what reason if the device is connected with my mobile.... It is not getting connected with my laptop until I disconnect it from my mobile.... Once it is connected with my laptop I'll connect it back with my phone. (Not sure if everybody is Facing this issue)4) Normally the pause button works on youtube...

3359,"It's not bad, but not good either. I bought it for 38,990. I was getting the same price for some other acer laptop with intel i5 1155g7 processor and IPS display, but I missed the deal. So, I bought this ☹️.Pros:1- Performance is not an issue. Decent performance for most of the tasks.2- Didn't do gaming, so not sure of that. But for programming, it's good.3- Good for multitasking.4- Audio is good. It's not loud, but sufficient and it comes with Nahimic audio (for which you will have to download it's app) which enhances it's audio capabilities. Audio can be optimised for different purpose.5- Sufficient ports. Also have type C port.6- It has control center to control fan speed, external keyboard light, manage fan speed, power.7- Battery is decent and can last 4-5 hours on regular workload. But on heavy workload, it will last around 2-2.5 hours.8- Lookwise it is good.9- lifetime windows 11 home.Cons:1- Although display is antiglare FHD. It's not IPS, so it looks crisp but average. It's just ok for the purpose of coding or regular tasks where we just want the work to be done. Since viewing angle are bad, so for entertainment, it's good for single person for watching movies but not for multiple people. Display is not good for graphic designer who needs color accuracy.2- There is no backlit keyboard. So, if you want backlit, connect external keyboard with backlit.3- Although it has an SSD, I didn't find the boot time to be faster. It is fast but didn't meet my expectations.4- Graphic card is not dedicated which is just good for normal work. I don't think you will enjoy gaming on it. It can play light games but surely you won't enjoy gaming on such system. And it won't able to play high demanding games.5- Doesn't have activated ms office. You will have to buy it's keys.Note:You can install a separate harddisk (HDD) for storing data. Screws are provided with laptop.For me, the bottom side became very hot and fans started making noise, when it first arrived and I was installing windows updates on it first used it on my bed, that is without proper ventilation. But with proper air flow, it doesn't heat.Conclusion:If you are limited on budget and only want your work to be done and doesn't care much about display quality or back lit keyboard or you aren't a gamer, you can buy it.And if you already bought it, don't regret your decision. It's a ok laptop for most of the task and will get your work done.",4.0 out of 5 stars

3422,"If one is looking for a excellent value for money then go for this laptop. Especially if the work to be done is browsing, youtube, office applications (spreadsheets/word/presentations/notes), documents etc. Small time games are also good on this but do not expect to tear through any Frame rates for Valorant or Fortnite or Halo or Call of Duty. This is not the target audience for this laptop.If work related to ML and Large datasets is desired to be conducted on this laptop then please note this will not be as fast as the latest i5 or i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 or Ryzen 6 but compared to other i3 and AMD Ryzen 3 this will perform much better.Basically the need for a powerful laptop or desktop is going away. Unless one is into heavy gaming or working with humongous data sets or require 6-8 hrs or battery backup. Also for gaming the power and performance that game consoles, Sony PS + MS XBox, offer are simply too good. Save some money in buying laptops and go for tablets from Samsung and Apple.The pros are given below followed by Cons1) It comes in with DDR4-3200 8GB RAM in a single slot. It has two slots and can be upgraded to 32GB. This will keep this laptop working for atleast 4-6 years. Again no other laptop at this price range offers this capability.2) Its CPU is about 2 years old but in this price range, i.e. Rs 30000/- it simply blows everything away. Including latest gen competing offerings from AMD and even the latest generation offerings from Intel. Basically its graphics helps which is again better than the latest gen offerings from intel at the same price bracket.3) It is light.4) It has 2 USB 2.0 ports, one USB-C port and one USB 3.0 port along with HDMI and RJ-45 network connection. Again no laptop at this price point has this many combination of the ports.5) It does not come with any bloatware apart from a few Acer utilities. Other laptops from competing brands come with a lot of bloatware and not required software.6) It has PCI 4.0 inside, again no competing model in this price range has this or higher value. So if one upgrades to a good RAM with good CL and a blazing fast SSD this should have a excellent price-to-performance.Now for the Cons1) Viewing angles of the screen are not that good. The screen needs to be at least 115 degrees or more to be viewed properly. Otherwise the colours are washed out.2) Its Battery has not been tested so cannot confirm.3) Its port placements is bad. Majority of users are right handed. But the USB 3.0 and USB-C ports are on the right. Ideally the MicroSD card slot, SIM Card slot as well as Lock port should be on the right with all the USB ports and HDMI on the left. There is a reason why Apple has done something similar on its laptops.4) It has a full sized 101/105 keyboard. This is the era of small keyboard. There is no need to give such a full sized keyboard. If someone needs an additional numeric keyboard there bluetooth and wired USB ones available.",5.0 out of 5 stars

3486,"I had the opportunity to use the HP 15s 11th Generation Intel i3 laptop for a while, and I must say that it is a pretty decent machine. While it may not be the most powerful laptop out there, it is certainly a good choice for everyday use.The laptop is equipped with an 11th Generation Intel i3 processor, which is fast enough for most tasks such as web browsing, word processing, and watching videos. The 15.6-inch Full HD display is bright and clear, and the colors are vibrant. The keyboard is comfortable to type on, and the touchpad is responsive and accurate.One thing I really appreciate about this laptop is its design. It has a sleek and modern look with a slim profile, making it easy to carry around. The build quality is solid, and it feels sturdy in your hand. The laptop also has a good selection of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and a headphone jack, which makes it easy to connect to external devices.Another aspect of this laptop that I like is its battery life. The laptop has a decent battery life, lasting around 7-8 hours on a single charge. This is good enough for a full day's work or study without having to worry about finding a power outlet.However, there are a few downsides to this.the laptop's performance may be lacking if you plan to use it for more demanding tasks such as gaming or video editing.Overall, I would give the HP 15s 11th Generation Intel i3 laptop a four-star rating. It is a good laptop for everyday use, with a sleek design, solid build quality, decent performance, and good battery life. However, it may not be the best choice for users who need more storage or require high-performance computing.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Performace is good as the clock speed of processor is 3 Ghz (not 4.1 which is maximum extent of clocking purformance of the processor.Pro:-1. Looks premium ( hp logo is cheery on top)2. Keyboard quality is good and all necessary keys are present on keyboard (no need of pressing fn for some important keys like home, pageup and page down etc.3. Speaker quality is very good compared to lenovo, asus or dell in this price range. Loud and clear.4. Two usb type A 3.0 and one usb type C 3.0 (might be 3.2 I am not sure)5. Pre-installed OS and office with lifetime validity6. Browsing speed is also very goodCon:-1. Visibility of alphabets and numbers becomes very bad in low light condition (might not be a con for experienced typist). Keys are not even like somwhere its ok and somwhere its bumpy or not aligned properly. But typing will not get affected.2. Screen quality is very down grade. Other laptops like Asus are providing Oled display in this price range. Brightness is very low. My old lenovo Ideapad has better brightness and clearity of screen than this laptop (which I bought for Rs. 25K before 5 years)3. For those who wants to extend the screen for uptop 2 monitors, the given USB C port doesnt support video output so you can only connect one monitor at a time.4. No option to expand SSD storage as it only supports 512 Gb (which is already included) and no extra SSD slot or even HDD slot.Can't say:1. Performace will get tested after heavy usage so will update later2. Not faced heating issue which will only get tested after heavy usageEdit:1) Battery last for 6 to 7 hours while using only excel or any other basic work2) Good news for GTA 5 lovers as it can run but on low settings.

Not much heating problem as far now with my experience.6. Windows 11 is really good.7. Connectivity speed and Bluetooth are good.8. Battery charge lasting for nearly 4 hours in normal usage. Atleast you can watch one full movie.Con's :1. Plastic body above average quality, personally not like it.2. Camera is low average quality only.3. Screen brightness needs to be increased atleast 50%+ to get 10% level of brightness from other laptop's.4. Mouse pad right click may damage the pad soon if you use many times. (we have double tap options so atleast it helps to avoid that cause)5. Charging cable cord length is too short.6. Screen pixal quality is average one.7. Charger quality is not good.8. Charging takes 2+ hours to fill the battery.I didn't played any games so far so not sure about gaming.",4.0 out of 5 stars
3672,"What i like:* The laptop seems to be on the lighter side and it's a good thing.* The top cover is metallic and feels durable* Lenovo laptop keyboard are nice to type and the fonts and the layout are perfect.* Integrated fingerprint sensor on the Powerbutton is very convenient and i prefer more than the one present on the touchpad.* Battery life is also good and will try to update after months of used.* Speaker are also decent for media.* Screen bezels are also slim and it looks a little bit smaller compare to mi notebook 14.* Touchpad is large and accurate.* Presence of physical webcam shutter is a bonus point.What i didn't like:* Display colour accuracy is on the lower side, but it's what to expect on this price range. It's good for media consumption but don't rely on for colour works.* Sound lack low tones* wish that it support type c charging.",4.0 out of 5 stars
3673,"This is the perfect laptop I was searching for my daily tasks and office work as it has everything I wanted i.e. 512 GB SSD, 8 GB RAM (expandable upto 12 GB), backlit keyboard, Fingerprint sensor etc.The only thing which was confusing me was the difference between all the four models which are listed.To keep it simple, don't purchase the model with the highest price i.e. 82H700UYIN, as I found no such difference between 82H700UYIN (highest price) and 82H701DKIN (priced just below the 1st one).Besides this, if you want to consider the lower two variants i.e. 82H700V2IN & 82H701DMIN, than you can go for it.Just the difference you'll find will be clock speed and expandability of RAM and one or two more differences. Just check thoroughly the specs.And if you are thinking of buying top varaint then it will be waste of few thousand rupees. But if you find or know any difference between those two high priced variants the please reply to my review.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I really liked this laptop conducting it's light weight, fast power up time, value for money and attractive design.0.5 star less because of low battery stand by time and lack of c type charger.Charger adapter is bigger in size and it's at plug socket side as compared to regulate laptop charger.

3745,"It's not bad, but not good either. I bought it for 38,990. I was getting the same price for some other acer laptop with intel i5 1155g7 processor and IPS display, but I missed the deal. So, I bought this ☹️.Pros:1- Performance is not an issue. Decent performance for most of the tasks.2- Didn't do gaming, so not sure of that. But for programming, it's good.3- Good for multitasking.4- Audio is good. It's not loud, but sufficient and it comes with Nahimic audio (for which you will have to download it's app) which enhances it's audio capabilities. Audio can be optimised for different purpose.5- Sufficient ports. Also have type C port.6- It has control center to control fan speed, external keyboard light, manage fan speed, power.7- Battery is decent and can last 4-5 hours on regular workload. But on heavy workload, it will last around 2-2.5 hours.8- Lookwise it is good.9- lifetime windows 11 home.Cons:1- Although display is antiglare FHD. It's not IPS, so it looks crisp but average. It's just ok for the purpose of coding or regular tasks where we just want the work to be done. Since viewing angle are bad, so for entertainment, it's good for single person for watching movies but not for multiple people. Display is not good for graphic designer who needs color accuracy.2- There is no backlit keyboard. So, if you want backlit, connect external keyboard with backlit.3- Although it has an SSD, I didn't find the boot time to be faster. It is fast but didn't meet my expectations.4- Graphic card is not dedicated which is just good for normal work. I don't think you will enjoy gaming on it. It can play light games but surely you won't enjoy gaming on such system. And it won't able to play high demanding games.5- Doesn't have activated ms office. You will have to buy it's keys.Note:You can install a separate harddisk (HDD) for storing data. Screws are provided with laptop.For me, the bottom side became very hot and fans started making noise, when it first arrived and I was installing windows updates on it first used it on my bed, that is without proper ventilation. But with proper air flow, it doesn't heat.Conclusion:If you are limited on budget and only want your work to be done and doesn't care much about display quality or back lit keyboard or you aren't a gamer, you can buy it.And if you already bought it, don't regret your decision. It's a ok laptop for most of the task and will get your work done.",4.0 out of 5 stars

But not always, only in heavy usage time like charging while downloading through poor network.Keyboard quality is also not bad.Screen quality may be better but according to budget it's compromisable.There is also a camera shutter to inhance privacy.Storage is expandable upto 1TB SSD at least.I got a replacement because of charging issue with first one.",5.0 out of 5 stars

They are known for their sturdy built and top quality parts used.This model MSI GF63 Thin, Intel Core i5-11260H, 8gb/512gb laptop is light weight, has a red backlit keyboard which looks cool. I added one Crucial brand 8gb ram for a total of 16gb ram, had a spare 2.5"" 1tb SSD which I installed also for a total of 1.5tb storage and was good to go. Both were easy to install and upgrades were instantly recognized by laptop.Brushed aluminum on top gives a premium look, screen resolution is good, battery is decent, speakers being at bottom the sound is not to so clear but using headphone is excellent.

3859," Title: The MSI GF63 Gaming Laptop - A True Gaming Powerhouse!I recently purchased the MSI GF63 gaming laptop, and I must say, it has completely exceeded my expectations in every way possible. This laptop is an absolute game-changer, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.Performance:The MSI GF63 is a beast when it comes to performance. With its powerful Intel Core i7 processor and NVIDIA GeForce GTX graphics card, it handles even the most demanding games and applications with ease. I've experienced buttery-smooth gameplay and lightning-fast load times, making my gaming experience truly immersive.Design:The laptop's sleek and modern design is not only aesthetically pleasing but also practical. It's incredibly thin and lightweight, making it easy to carry around. The slim bezel display provides an immersive visual experience, and the backlit keyboard is not only comfortable for long gaming sessions but also adds a cool factor to the laptop's overall look.Display:The 15.6-inch Full HD display is nothing short of stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the sharpness of the images is impressive. Whether I'm gaming, watching movies, or working on creative projects, the display never disappoints.Cooling:One of the standout features of this laptop is its excellent cooling system. It manages to keep the laptop cool even during intense gaming sessions, thanks to MSI's innovative cooling technology. This ensures that the laptop runs smoothly without any overheating issues.Battery Life:Considering its gaming prowess, the battery life is surprisingly good. I can get several hours of productivity or entertainment on a single charge, making it versatile for both work and play.Audio:The audio quality on the MSI GF63 is exceptional. The built-in speakers deliver clear and immersive sound, and the Nahimic audio enhancer software allows for customizable audio profiles, enhancing the gaming and multimedia experience.Price:Considering the high-end components and top-notch performance, the MSI GF63 offers incredible value for its price. It competes with laptops that are much more expensive but still manages to outperform them in many aspects.In conclusion, the MSI GF63 gaming laptop has won me over completely. It's a powerhouse of performance, style, and value.

3900, I received this laptop 💻 two days ago.I like anti-glare display and screen quality is above average.Celeron N4020 processor is not for gaming bcz in this price range please don't expect laptops for gaming.You have given 256GB SSD M.2 NVME in just 26990 RS it's enough.This laptop is only for programming and office work.Highly recommended those who are looking for best laptop under 30000.Build quality and look of this laptop is 4.99 out of 5.0 .One bad thing about this laptop 💻 is that does not have a keyboard backlight.And I'll edit this review as I use this laptop.I hope this honest review will help many people 🙏.,5.0 out of 5 stars

My samsung M series smart phone as better sound that this laptop. Must not be that expensive. As an alternative I use headphone or blue tooth speaker.2. keypad layout, that small shift button on right, causes issue. I am using external keyboard at workaround.OK things:1. Battery life: 6 -7 hours with usual usage surfing the web, videos, programming etc. Not bad.2. Track pad.Great Things:1. Display. I would have loved it without antiglare coating. But still great!2. speed, i5, 16GB nvme ram. U can feel it much faster while using. May b because its is new.3. Fingerprint scanner: I loved it. So fast and accurate. Major feel good factor.4.

Comes with Genuine Windows 11 Home along with pre-installed MS Office 2021 Home & Student edition, so nothing else to worry about or no need to spend any additional money on SW.

3965,"okay got the ultra today and the display is not as amazing as advertised imho. It is extremely sharp (thanks to the 2000p display!) but not at all color accurate. So over saturated that it gives mi and realme phone camera vibes lol. Another example after the iPhone 11 that proves higher resolution != better display.I have an old hp pavilion 14 x360 (14inch 1080p), LG 22MK600M monitor (22 inch IPS LCD 1080p), Lenovo L24i-30 monitor (24 inch IPS LCD 1080p) to compare with and have to say color reproduction is not at all natural on the Mi laptop. And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green. Even looking at the long shots of the trees you can tell the display is so over saturated. Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).However everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch.

They first check with window updates then found out that issue is with keypad ( keys are shorting) and took 3-4 days (parts availability + installation).At that time, because of warranty I got a replacement of keypad for free of cost.Now again after 10 months, my scrolls/keypad is not working properly so this time I visited Vashi service center. Same here they are not able to recognise problem at once. They suggest me to go for trail and error method and charging amount accordingly to that.This time my warranty is over and now you people will going to charge 3k to 4k to solve the same issue which happened earlier.My question is1. Why Service Centre employees are not properly trained ?They not even checked laptop, only listen to what we are saying and suggest 2/3 solutions.2. I bought this laptop for 56k only 14 months back, then why same issue is happening within 10 months gap.4.Even your spare parts are not easily available in the market so that we can take help of external service center.

But it is not great as mentioned. Contrast could be better. Whites are too bright. Not comfortable to read. Color is definitely not accurate.* Performance : It is good.* Track Pad: Total Crap. Not pleasant to work. It make horrible sound at times and only the center area works consistent.* Speakers : You mean this laptop has inbuilt speakers ? I doubt. Please stay away from this product if you cant use headphone or bluetooth speaker with this product. Of all the mobiles, laptops, tablets I used in my life, definitely this could be the one having worst speaker.* Build : It is built good. It looks like Mac. (It only looks). Mac build quality is far superior.* Battery: You could get 4 to 5 hours. I dont understand how company claims 10/12 hours. Charging speed is only average and not very fast. It takes ages to charge when you use the laptop.* Keyboard: Yes. It has keyboard and you can type :-)I have office MAC and a 3 years old 25K dell i3 laptop along with this.

3983," Positive points1. build quality is next level, like premium product2. Screen quality is awesome ❤️ colors are awesome3. Battery backup is around 9 hours if laptop screen is on 60hzs refresh rate . If you use 90hzs then you can get battery backup max around 3hrs.4. File transfer speed is awesome . I move 13gb file to another drive it take less than a minute. Transfer speed (300mbps to 600mbps)5. Keys are really soft6. Camera quality is everage.Negative points1. Big negative point is Speakers. Even my phone speaker is louder than laptop speaker2. Can handle games on low resolution this is not a gaming laptop so keep in mind before buy.",4.0 out of 5 stars
3984," Display is crisp and clearPerformance is good tooDrives are good tooFingerprint is awesomeFront cam is above average (good)Build quality is premiuim (macbook feel)But Xiaomi lacked few things which I noticedThere's no OEM Windows disk included or atleast they should attach a link on their website where all drivers are available.There's no support assist app which can help in installation of drivers, like dell have dell assist and every other brands have that.Speaker quality is good but it's not loud unless you turn off DTS processing app.External graphics card is supported thanks to Thunderbolt 4 but there should have one more option with discrete graphics card for civil and mechanical engineers.This pc can handle casual gaming but for heavy gaming it should not be your first choice.",4.0 out of 5 stars

3986,Best possible clone of MacBook in your budget.I tried to install MacOS and shared this photo with my friends and they thought it was MacBook 😂Pros -1) Metal build2) Battery backup (my case 6-7hrs)3) Display quality with 90hz performs really well for editing4) Wi-Fi 6 has great connectivity and has thunderbolt 4 portCons-1) It would be great if it come with Ryzen variant and 2gb graphics card2) Intel iris xe donot performs well in high end games (tried watch dogs2)3) the velcro for binding the charger wire is little small and can have problem while binding the wiresOverall it is a good clone for MacBook which comes in a pocket. But there are some concerns about the after sale services..... Let's see it how it happens in upcoming days 😊,4.0 out of 5 stars
3987,"I was impressed with the specs on papers and yes it delivers that. Everyone has mentioned the pros but after using it for two months, now I think I am in a condition to answer the cons.Pros : you all know .Cons :1. Keyboard is trash. My key (Number 4) came out immediately after purchase. Even i am so fed up of the keyboard , I am using my bluetooth keyboard instead of it.2. When you lock your pc and login again, then suddenly the content on the web browser vanishes for like a long time and you loose control of your screen. Even after having a good processor with SSD, this should not happen.Rest I am happy with the experience.",4.0 out of 5 stars
3988,"Bought the Mi Ultra laptop during the first sale on 31st Aug. Extremely disappointed with the laptop as well as Mi Support.12/09: Laptop doesn't turn on anymore. It has been 10 days, so cannot even return it. On the 6th day, the laptop went into a continuous restart loop which I fixed with hard shut down 3 times after watching some YouTube videos. And then it was working okay for 2 days. Now it doesn't even start. The charge light also doesn't come on. Nothing happens on pressing the power button. Nothing happens when you connect the charger. It's dead. Need to take it to the service center just 10 days into the purchase! Don't buy this, all the great specs are useless if it doesn't start!Update 13/09: I gave it for service and they are saying the battery and motherboard is defective and they need to replace it! I'm shocked. It's a brand new laptop and in 10 days the battery and motherboard is gone? How can that happen? I've hardly even used it! And they also say that since it's a new laptop the parts are taking time to come to the service center! Better to buy a reliable HP, Dell, Lenovo laptop even if it's a bit more expensive!Update 20/09: It has been with Mi service center for 8 days now. Everytime I call them they say it will get fixed in 2 days. On probing further they said there is a hardware problem. The battery and motherboard needs to be replaced! Wow I can't understand how the battery and motherboard can have problems in just 10 days of purchase? It's clearly a manufacturing defect from Xiaomi. They say they have ordered the parts but they haven't received it since it's a new model! Unbelievable!Just lost lot of money and peace with this laptop! Don't trust Xiaomi from now.23/09: They called me from the service center and asked me to collect a replacement laptop. I got a brand new laptop unopened and I opened it and checked in the service center itself. It seems that they couldn't fix the old laptop and had to send it back, so I got lucky. Else, I would have got a repaired one.Anyway, I'm happy I got a new replacement laptop and currently it's working well.",1.0 out of 5 stars

3993, The laptop is extremely well builtI have i5 8gb variant as 16 gb was out of stock.1) performance is great for this price range is great2) battery life is also good for an instance i started at 9 in the morning at 100% and it lasted for 2 pm.In meanwhile i was continuously using it at 90hz 3 tabs were open in chrome and it was connected to wifi and Bluetooth display brightness was 50% as i was indoor.3) Gaming I don't do heavy gaming but i played valorant on it at 1080p low graphics and it was giving around 50 to 80 fps . maybe 16 gb varient will give 60 to 90%.4) Charging while using it takes around 3 hours.5) speakers are a little bit low but i didn't faced any problem as i always use earphones or headphones.6) heating i didn't faced any major heating issue.I tried 4k video rendering and valorant but the temperature never exceeded 80°C . As i am coming from acer Predator it was really good because in Predator temperature is around 95+ while gaming or editing.But after two days when i was doing a typing test its tab key poped out of keyboard.So immediately contact Amazon and hopefully they raised an return.This time i will wait for 16gb.,5.0 out of 5 stars

I worked for nearly 5 hours (out of which 2 hrs of zoom calls) and 50% drained.3) Camera:Camera is just fine for video calls, not bad actually as it's used mainly for video conferences or online classes etc.4) Speakers:Inbuilt speakers are fine for the above mentioned uses. I felt it's more effective when it's kept on a surface than we keep it on lap.5) Performance:Performance wise there is not much notable difference from those of others with the same specification3) Others:Fingerprint, keyboard, mouse pad are also impressive in the first instance.My take: Overall a good, worthy and budget friendly product when compared to those in the same category!Thanks to Amazon too, to deliver it quickly and to give an option to buy for a day when the stock is up",5.0 out of 5 stars

Another example after the iPhone 11 that proves higher resolution != better display.I have an old hp pavilion 14 x360 (14inch 1080p), LG 22MK600M monitor (22 inch IPS LCD 1080p), Lenovo L24i-30 monitor (24 inch IPS LCD 1080p) to compare with and have to say color reproduction is not at all natural on the Mi laptop. And yeah it is the worst of the 4 with Lenovo at 3rd HP 2nd and LG the best. I tested with the famous costa rica 4k video and the greens and yellows on the snake at 0: 07 are so so poor that it almost feels like one bright green.

Especially looking side by side with others, the differences could easily be spotted (tbh there's no need to look side by side either. you can tell easily, unless you're coming from a TN panel).However everything else about the laptop is great (would've loved ryzen but it's okay considering intel iris xe). 16GB ram with i5 is a combination most tasks find useful but rarely available. Quality of life features like Battery life, thunderbolt, type-c charging, fp scanner, large track-pad and better than average keyboard (I'm used to mechanical so can't appreciate much). Restart takes like 15sec max. wake up from sleep is instant. excellent build (although my hp x360 is good too, so it's not as 'awe'ing to me). the hinge is so satisfying. It's all top notch. Only display didn't reach the expectation.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Because Bios is designed by Mi, So it doesn't have many options to modify or change according to your needs. Overall performance is good. But Amazon doesn't help you with any kind of assistance regarding product. When I got my product, packaging was damaged and in few days of delivery, Display bleeding starts. So I visited Mi Service Center but in terms of laptop repairing, Staff is not qualified. So If You just want it for games and others stuff, you can buy it.

Worst service centerI bought a laptop in May 2022 which start giving me an issue after only 3 months of use.I visited Xiaomi Service center Thane , which literally unable to glance issue at once. They first check with window updates then found out that issue is with keypad ( keys are shorting) and took 3-4 days (parts availability + installation).At that time, because of warranty I got a replacement of keypad for free of cost.Now again after 10 months, my scrolls/keypad is not working properly so this time I visited Vashi service center. Same here they are not able to recognise problem at once. They suggest me to go for trail and error method and charging amount accordingly to that.This time my warranty is over and now you people will going to charge 3k to 4k to solve the same issue which happened earlier.My question is1. Why Service Centre employees are not properly trained ?They not even checked laptop, only listen to what we are saying and suggest 2/3 solutions.2. I bought this laptop for 56k only 14 months back, then why same issue is happening within 10 months gap.4.Even your spare parts are not easily available in the market so that we can take help of external service center.

4079,"This is my Honest Opinion on the Product. Btw, I am a big fan of Xiaomi. Never had bad experience with their mobile, speaker etc except one from the TV.* Display : It is good. But it is not great as mentioned. Contrast could be better. Whites are too bright. Not comfortable to read. Color is definitely not accurate.* Performance : It is good.* Track Pad: Total Crap. Not pleasant to work. It make horrible sound at times and only the center area works consistent.* Speakers : You mean this laptop has inbuilt speakers ? I doubt. Please stay away from this product if you cant use headphone or bluetooth speaker with this product. Of all the mobiles, laptops, tablets I used in my life, definitely this could be the one having worst speaker.* Build : It is built good. It looks like Mac. (It only looks). Mac build quality is far superior.* Battery: You could get 4 to 5 hours. I dont understand how company claims 10/12 hours. Charging speed is only average and not very fast. It takes ages to charge when you use the laptop.* Keyboard: Yes. It has keyboard and you can type :-)I have office MAC and a 3 years old 25K dell i3 laptop along with this. My satisfaction with this product is no way near to any of my previous windows laptops.These companies should be sued for horribly wrong descriptions like 12 hours battery when you cant even get 5 hours, DTS Audio when you cant even hear anything from the speakers etc.",2.0 out of 5 stars

4092,"Bought the Mi Ultra laptop during the first sale on 31st Aug. Extremely disappointed with the laptop as well as Mi Support.12/09: Laptop doesn't turn on anymore. It has been 10 days, so cannot even return it. On the 6th day, the laptop went into a continuous restart loop which I fixed with hard shut down 3 times after watching some YouTube videos. And then it was working okay for 2 days. Now it doesn't even start. The charge light also doesn't come on. Nothing happens on pressing the power button. Nothing happens when you connect the charger. It's dead. Need to take it to the service center just 10 days into the purchase! Don't buy this, all the great specs are useless if it doesn't start!Update 13/09: I gave it for service and they are saying the battery and motherboard is defective and they need to replace it! I'm shocked. It's a brand new laptop and in 10 days the battery and motherboard is gone? How can that happen? I've hardly even used it! And they also say that since it's a new laptop the parts are taking time to come to the service center! Better to buy a reliable HP, Dell, Lenovo laptop even if it's a bit more expensive!Update 20/09: It has been with Mi service center for 8 days now. Everytime I call them they say it will get fixed in 2 days. On probing further they said there is a hardware problem. The battery and motherboard needs to be replaced! Wow I can't understand how the battery and motherboard can have problems in just 10 days of purchase? It's clearly a manufacturing defect from Xiaomi. They say they have ordered the parts but they haven't received it since it's a new model! Unbelievable!Just lost lot of money and peace with this laptop! Don't trust Xiaomi from now.23/09: They called me from the service center and asked me to collect a replacement laptop. I got a brand new laptop unopened and I opened it and checked in the service center itself. It seems that they couldn't fix the old laptop and had to send it back, so I got lucky. Else, I would have got a repaired one.Anyway, I'm happy I got a new replacement laptop and currently it's working well.",1.0 out of 5 stars

As i am coming from acer Predator it was really good because in Predator temperature is around 95+ while gaming or editing.But after two days when i was doing a typing test its tab key poped out of keyboard.So immediately contact Amazon and hopefully they raised an return.This time i will wait for 16gb.,5.0 out of 5 stars

You will have to configure the code count and cou+gpu wattage manual from armory crate to get best results.- Built qualit is very nice, fells like it was thought through, avoiding unnecessary metal keeps the weight down aswell.Cons- Mini LED Display is a let down, glitchy firmware causing screen to go blank/crash very frequently when using dedicated GPU mode. Even when it works, the HDR is not very good, 1000 is too less atleast 4000 mini led required for it to be meaning ful, either opt for non mini led ot OLED.- wifi chip could have been better, like the killer pro, it's not bad by any means but, for a SCAR series I expected better.- boot up time is surprisingly slow 8-10 secs- the huge power adapter with 16 Amp socket is difficult to plugin in public places if you travel.Verdict- Really good product from Asus, suits all my Development and Gaming needs with butter smooth ease.- get the model without the mini led, this feels like a gimmick, not worth the extra 10k, i certainly keep it turned off.",4.0 out of 5 stars

But i can't complain cause the box wasn't damaged.The laptop is sleek and sturdy. I received it today so i cant comment on its performance but its Ryzen5 5500u so ofcourse its gonna be impressive.Display is really good. Battery reduced from 100% to 82% in 3hrs of normal video playback, some music and managing some settings. And took 1.5hrs to charge from 30% to 100%. But i think the battery backup is good when its above 60% but after that it drains fast (i used it for 30-40mins for simple work and the battery went from 43 to 32).Size is perfect for me as a student. Sound is quite impressive too. Fingerprint is seriously fast. Backlit is not the best backlit keyboard but its okay. Only disappointment is that there's no lifetime MS office.

I did not test it on Windows.- Sound output is very weak. Having additional speaker (Bluetooth) is a must.- Hangs when you demand more CPU (it could be Ubuntu specific issue) during Video Conf presentations.- Camera is positioned on keyboard.

4180,"Pros:This device is great if you're under a budget and need it for basic academic purposes. The one I purchased comes with a liftetime subscription of ms office 2021. Size is very compact and anti glare display. Battery life is average, 5hr on idle and 3hrs if you're working on it. It charges pretty fast so that makes up for the battery life. Response time is fast so it is good if you're working on multiple windows. It is overall excellent for the price. It is suitable for web browsing, research, presentations, light video editing and media entertainment. If you want a higher configuration than this, you could go for the Acer aspire lite or the Acer aspire 3 series, they are under 40k.Cons:Device heats up pretty fast, it's not suitable for gaming.

4200,"REDEFINES BUDGET LAPTOPSReview Date: May 24, 2022VERDICT: DEFINITE BUY.SUMMARY: Score: 9.0/10.Back with HP after 14 years and loving it!This is an excellent laptop that redefines what budget laptops offer. Looks, features, performance and battery life- all at a different level. Rivals laptops that retailed at 50k just a few months back. This is only the 3rd time in 20 years that something has felt like a REAL upgrade in technology (first was Ahtlon 64, next was affordable SSDs, and now this).Additionally, nowadays, you get Windows and Office free for the device’s life. Solid hardware specs and useful software pre-loaded means a complete laptop that does not need any user expertise in upgrading.USAGE: 3 daysPROCESSES FOLLOWED: 3 full battery cycles, debloating (McAfee, LastPass, some MS games), some power management tweaksREVIEW:Key Laptop components reviewed below with Pros and Cons of each. CASE AND BUILD: 9/10Full plastic. Compact but chunky. Lid is plain. Keyboard panel is brushed finish. Bottom is matte plastic.PROS: Looks good. Compact but chunky. Comfortable to hold.CONS: Plain lid attracts dust and fingerprints. LID: 9/10Black matte finish on the inside. Hinge is firm. No wobble. Opens to approx. 115 deg.PROS: Seems reliable enough.CONS: Single hinge design forces keyboard down, reducing area available for trackpad. KEYBOARD: 9/10Backlit (2 levels). Separate paging keys. Lights for Caps Lock and Audio Off (no idea why).PROS: Keys slightly scalloped, offering good hold. Separate paging keys are a life saver when working in Excel. Two Stage backlight. Tactile (but little mushy). Give it 1-2 days to break in.CONS: Slightly noisy when typing fast. No dedicated function keys for Mic Off/ Sleep. Power button is recessed, causing some misses when pressing. TRACKPAD: 7/10Area seems 16+:9 (like current smartphones). Slightly rough texture. Slight rattle when tapping. But way more reliable and smooth than Asus’ touchpads.PROs: Smooth and accurate tracking.CONs: Tapping is very uncomfortable (due to the clattering noise)- so dragging may not be comfortable. SCREEN: 9/10Glossy screen. Gives sharp text and good contrast. Can use 14” at 100% scaling (or for older guys) 115%.PROs: Bright. Excellent contrast. Text is sharp and readable.CONs: Contrast and colour balance drop off below 80% brightness. PORTS: 8/101 SD Card reader (full size), 1x HDMI, 2xUSB3-A, 1xUSB-C, 1x3.5mm.PROs: Strong suite of ports.CONs: All (except SD Card) are on the right side. Using a mouse is a pain. UPGRADABILITY: 9/10PROs: 2 separate RAM slots (have not opened, checked from reviews).CONs: At least 4 screws are located under the 2 rubber pads. Not user upgradeable. SOFTWARE: 10/10Windows 11 Home. System Encryption is available. Office H&S 2021 for life. A few bloatware- McAfee, LastPass and some Windows games. Easy to uninstall. PERFORMANCE: 10/10The Ryzen 3 5300U is freakishly fast! Cannot believe this level of performance at ₹40k. Launching apps, multi-tasking, etc.- all effortless.PROs: Super-powerful CPU. Stays cool. Also easy to control turbo in Windows 11 (unlike Ryzen 3 3250U)- setting Max CPU level at 99% limits speed to 2.6GHz. Under normal usage (setting up laptop, indexing, etc.) in peak Delhi summer in non-AC room, CPU temp was 45-55 deg C (Asus’ Ryzen 3 3250 model runs at 80+ deg C). Keyboard stays cool.CONs: Fan response seems slow. Stays quiet for some time, suddenly ramps up to a single speed for some minutes and slows down again. Small distraction. BATTERY: 10/10Battery is rated at 41.050Wh. Max was at 41.005Wh. Battery is the older higher voltage kind (11-13V), compared to the newer 8V ones. But my experience with older batteries has been much better. The newer ones dropped off faster after about 3 years. And usage of the same components would help HP keep costs in check. So no complaints.PROs: Excellent battery life. With some basic tweaks, power usage in normal situations is between 3-5W, giving a battery backup of 8Hrs-10+Hrs. I don’t think you can ask for anything more. Compare this with Asus’ Ryzen 3 3250U model where I had to do N things to get heat and battery backup to acceptable levels. I did not have to do anything special here.CONs: Imagine what would happen if HP gave a 56Whr battery- who needs a MacBook?COMPARED TO ASUS:Asus has been the leader in laptop innovations- bringing in Full HD and dual storage to budget laptops. I have 2 Asus systems. But of late they have started skimping in important areas- Semi-passive cooling leads to higher temperatures and frequent throttling of CPUs even in normal usages. Keyboards become uncomfortably hot. Screens are matte (useful), but have very low contrast (text is harder to read when documents are zoomed out). HDD installation kits are cheap and flimsy. I’ve seen in 2 cases where the cheap cable causes data transfer errors and Windows crashes as well (for the record, I have Windows 10/11 in 4 PCs from 1st Gen Intel to 7th Gen- and there was not a single crash in any of them).When I bought a new Asus Vivobook a few months back, it was a big disappointment. I felt like I was back in the Windows XP days when I used to spend hours trying to get things to work. This HP has been a very good experience. Fully specced, well configured and works as it should.",5.0 out of 5 stars

4202,"I bought this laptop on summer sale. Here is the review after 2-3 weeks of usage.Pros:1. Budget - Bought this laptop for 32K after discounts.2. Processor - Ryzen 3 with 4 cores with 16GB of RAM.3. MS office with lifetime validity.4. Screen quality is excellent.5. Light weight - Weights around 1.5 KG, which is very easy to carry for daily use.6. Battery backup - On an average battery with stands for 6 to 8 hours after full charge (Continuously browsing, doing office work).7. Screen size - 14 inch which is easy to carry.8. Boot time - Takes around 8 to 10 seconds to reach login screen (Win 11 is pre-installed)9. Track pad is precise and responsive.10. Keys are large enough to hold & press. This laptop comes with backlit support, which is quite impressive.11. Speaker sound is above average.12. Camera quality is average but enough to attend meetings.Cons:1. Battery indicator is placed next to the charging port, sometimes it is quite difficult to find the laptop is charged or still charging.2. Build quality is average, sometimes I feel like keys not aligned properly.3. Warranty registration - Experienced difficulties to register for warranty with HP site.

4209,"I was having nearly three months of research to find out a best laptop for both personal and professional use that comes within a range of 40 to 60 K. HP 14s is the one which I concluded at last . After 2 weeks of experience I'm writing this review. The laptop works in a smooth way without any glitches and trouble.System Info :Model: HP 14s - FqOS : Windows 11. (X64)Processor : AMD Ryzen 5500 with 6 core and 12 logical processor. Base speed 2.1 Mhz and 4 Mhz with turbo boost.Graphic : AMD Radeon Graphics.RAM : 8 GB (Upgradeable).Drive memory: 512 SSD.Chipset : AMD Integrated SocWeb cam : 720 p Hd with dual microphone.Display : Full HD with thin basal, 60 Hz refresh state and 250 nits brightness. 14 inch size.Preinstalled Software: MS office Home and student (Without Outlook ), Mc Cafee antivirus (For one month), Drop Box subscription for 1 year (100nGb), Amazon Alexa.Warranty: 1 year (Extendable).Build Quality: Silver coloured with a metallic texture premium plastic body, with super comfortable key board having back lite ( Withou separate t number key) and a total weight of 1.45 Kg.Battery: 3 Cell ,41 Wh Li-ion .Now lets see the pros and cons which I observed.Pros : Super thin body with think Basel screen and super viewing experience. Light weight and will give you a good sound experience. Web came us fair enough for meetings. Good experience while coding, basic games ,videos, music, typing, and general office and personal use. Exhaust is designed according to the dynamics so the air flow will go upward via next to the screen without effecting the screen at all.Cons : Could have equipped with a privacy shutter for web cam, One thump opening of display is not possible (Cuz of that the weight is not much ), CPU fan sometimes rotate high speed which make a little noise. CPU gets hot a little some time ( But gets normal immediately).

4216,"This is a great laptop and best in the price bracket. under 40K you get 8Gb of 3200Mhz DDR4 ram with 512 SSD and windows 11 pre installed with office 2019 license. Screen is decent, not the best, not the worst.the only way you get to know it's not built well, when you type on the keyboard. there is a lot of flex to the keyboard and as I am power user, I find it little disappointing. I bought this laptop for my father and he was happy with it. Battery life if good and laptop doesn't heat much.coming to my issue : - My system had an issue with motherboard that battery used to get drained while it was turned off or in hibernation. I was losing 45% per 12hours of system being shutdown.this came to my notice after 7 days of purchase, else would have done the exchange with amazon.had to deal with HP customer support and it was a very horrendous experience. Their Customer support is pathetic but finally after tweeting continuously to their CEO on twitter, they listened to my issue and got me a refund from HP.ALL in all this is great Laptop, but alas my unit had issues.please ensure your vendor is in the approved HP list before buying it from amazon/ e-commerce websites to ensure maximum HP warranty support.",4.0 out of 5 stars

4325,"If one is looking for a excellent value for money then go for this laptop. Especially if the work to be done is browsing, youtube, office applications (spreadsheets/word/presentations/notes), documents etc. Small time games are also good on this but do not expect to tear through any Frame rates for Valorant or Fortnite or Halo or Call of Duty. This is not the target audience for this laptop.If work related to ML and Large datasets is desired to be conducted on this laptop then please note this will not be as fast as the latest i5 or i7 or AMD Ryzen 7 or Ryzen 6 but compared to other i3 and AMD Ryzen 3 this will perform much better.Basically the need for a powerful laptop or desktop is going away. Unless one is into heavy gaming or working with humongous data sets or require 6-8 hrs or battery backup. Also for gaming the power and performance that game consoles, Sony PS + MS XBox, offer are simply too good. Save some money in buying laptops and go for tablets from Samsung and Apple.The pros are given below followed by Cons1) It comes in with DDR4-3200 8GB RAM in a single slot. It has two slots and can be upgraded to 32GB. This will keep this laptop working for atleast 4-6 years. Again no other laptop at this price range offers this capability.2) Its CPU is about 2 years old but in this price range, i.e. Rs 30000/- it simply blows everything away. Including latest gen competing offerings from AMD and even the latest generation offerings from Intel. Basically its graphics helps which is again better than the latest gen offerings from intel at the same price bracket.3) It is light.4) It has 2 USB 2.0 ports, one USB-C port and one USB 3.0 port along with HDMI and RJ-45 network connection. Again no laptop at this price point has this many combination of the ports.5) It does not come with any bloatware apart from a few Acer utilities. Other laptops from competing brands come with a lot of bloatware and not required software.6) It has PCI 4.0 inside, again no competing model in this price range has this or higher value. So if one upgrades to a good RAM with good CL and a blazing fast SSD this should have a excellent price-to-performance.Now for the Cons1) Viewing angles of the screen are not that good. The screen needs to be at least 115 degrees or more to be viewed properly. Otherwise the colours are washed out.2) Its Battery has not been tested so cannot confirm.3) Its port placements is bad. Majority of users are right handed. But the USB 3.0 and USB-C ports are on the right. Ideally the MicroSD card slot, SIM Card slot as well as Lock port should be on the right with all the USB ports and HDMI on the left. There is a reason why Apple has done something similar on its laptops.4) It has a full sized 101/105 keyboard. This is the era of small keyboard. There is no need to give such a full sized keyboard. If someone needs an additional numeric keyboard there bluetooth and wired USB ones available.",5.0 out of 5 stars

4332,"Pros:This device is great if you're under a budget and need it for basic academic purposes. The one I purchased comes with a liftetime subscription of ms office 2021. Size is very compact and anti glare display. Battery life is average, 5hr on idle and 3hrs if you're working on it. It charges pretty fast so that makes up for the battery life. Response time is fast so it is good if you're working on multiple windows. It is overall excellent for the price. It is suitable for web browsing, research, presentations, light video editing and media entertainment. If you want a higher configuration than this, you could go for the Acer aspire lite or the Acer aspire 3 series, they are under 40k.Cons:Device heats up pretty fast, it's not suitable for gaming. Too much cpu usage even while doing basic tasks. Keyboard is a little flimsy however it works fine. It is quite heavy for the size.Overall this laptop is a 7/10.

Type c charging is great. If I forget my laptop charger at home, I can charge it with my 65w mobile warp charger. Handy.4. Wifi 6e. Future proof. Works great with my 5ghz router.

I leave my charger at home. The battery lasts the whole day with a weight of just 1350g. Majja ni life.Cons1. Gets hot while doing nothing. You can feel the heat on the keyboard.2. Charger is too heavy for a light weight laptop.3. Wrong information. No 6 month office 365 included. It asks for purchase. Customer care, no help yet.4. Screen is not HDR. I didn't check before purchasing, considering it as an obvious feature for the price.5. Lots of bloatware, i.e. Spotify and others6. Camera is said as 1080p. My USB 1080p external camera is way better than the inbuilt one. Don't know why so much difference. bad camera.7. Speeds up for the benchmark testing, starts heating and slows down (throttle) in less than 10 seconds. Cannot use i7 processor to its full potential because of throttling. Should have better cooling system.8. Keyboard, useless. As I gear up for touch typing screen starts shaking.9. Touchpad. Too big. Disturbs while typing.Update: Amazon and lg both denied providing 6 month subscription of the office 365.

4427,"Hi,I had used Mi notebook ultra and here is my comparison:* Display: On Paper Mi display is better with higher resolution and 90Hz refresh. But The contract I felt is better in Honor than Mi and web pages are more comfortable in Honor. Tough to pick a winner. But I personally liked Honor.* Build: Both are good. This is more compact. light than Mi and better for portability* Performance: I found both are good performance wise* Track Pad: Honor is better. Mi makes bad sounds when clicked. Mi track pad is bigger but sometimes not responsive in the corrners.* Keyboard: I did not find major differences. Both are more or less same. But Backlight is not good in Honor and way better in Mi* Speaker: No competition. Honor is way better than Mi. Mi speaker is almost non existent and cannot be used without external/bluetooth speaker.* Battery Life: I could get around 8 hours playing songs in youtube continuously. Similar test gave only 5 hours in Mi.Support: Not sure about Honor. But you will have may service centers for MiConnectivity: May be better in Mi as it might support thunderbolt and monitor connection on USB C. I have not tested in Mi though.Webcam: Not a dealbreaker but Honor camera angle may not be liked by everyone compared to standard camera positioning in Mi.Value for Money : Honor. That too great value of you get it under 40K. Mi is 12 to 15K more expensive than Honor.Conclusion: It should be an easy decision to buy Honor. You will love it.",4.0 out of 5 stars

4439,Got it for 41000 during a deal. I had been looking for a laptop in the price range of 1-1.2 lakh for some time now. Was waiting for AMD 7040U series to come to India. I bought this laptop for a relative and after using it for a week before handing it over to them i was just blown away. My main concern was battery life and this laptop gave 10 + hours of mixed world uses on battery everyday. I never thought that in something this cheap the battery life could be this good. the CPU is excellent specially the integrated graphics. played Valorant on this. Had a similarly priced core i3 10th gen laptop for comparison with equal ram size. I was getting around 90 fps on the intel version and battery life of 4 hours only. On this i got 150 fps on average and many of my general tasks which are based on CAD based application run very well. I was actually inclined to just buy this again for myself as its well within half of my budget and is capable to handle my daily workflow but decided to wait for zen4 based laptop because ryzen zen4 is even more efficient.,5.0 out of 5 stars

But if you just type or watch videos, then it will last upto 6-7 hours I guess, it could be sometimes less or even more.. I haven't tested until low battery, never been below 50% yet.Tips: avoid charging for long time when you're using the laptop, it may heat up a bit, but if you're doing heavy task then it's normal to plug in and work , Little bit heat is Normal since it's a metal body, heat spreads to keep the internal cooler",4.0 out of 5 stars

4463,"It's not bad, but not good either. I bought it for 38,990. I was getting the same price for some other acer laptop with intel i5 1155g7 processor and IPS display, but I missed the deal. So, I bought this ☹️.Pros:1- Performance is not an issue. Decent performance for most of the tasks.2- Didn't do gaming, so not sure of that. But for programming, it's good.3- Good for multitasking.4- Audio is good. It's not loud, but sufficient and it comes with Nahimic audio (for which you will have to download it's app) which enhances it's audio capabilities. Audio can be optimised for different purpose.5- Sufficient ports. Also have type C port.6- It has control center to control fan speed, external keyboard light, manage fan speed, power.7- Battery is decent and can last 4-5 hours on regular workload. But on heavy workload, it will last around 2-2.5 hours.8- Lookwise it is good.9- lifetime windows 11 home.Cons:1- Although display is antiglare FHD. It's not IPS, so it looks crisp but average. It's just ok for the purpose of coding or regular tasks where we just want the work to be done. Since viewing angle are bad, so for entertainment, it's good for single person for watching movies but not for multiple people. Display is not good for graphic designer who needs color accuracy.2- There is no backlit keyboard. So, if you want backlit, connect external keyboard with backlit.3- Although it has an SSD, I didn't find the boot time to be faster. It is fast but didn't meet my expectations.4- Graphic card is not dedicated which is just good for normal work. I don't think you will enjoy gaming on it. It can play light games but surely you won't enjoy gaming on such system. And it won't able to play high demanding games.5- Doesn't have activated ms office. You will have to buy it's keys.Note:You can install a separate harddisk (HDD) for storing data. Screws are provided with laptop.For me, the bottom side became very hot and fans started making noise, when it first arrived and I was installing windows updates on it first used it on my bed, that is without proper ventilation. But with proper air flow, it doesn't heat.Conclusion:If you are limited on budget and only want your work to be done and doesn't care much about display quality or back lit keyboard or you aren't a gamer, you can buy it.And if you already bought it, don't regret your decision. It's a ok laptop for most of the task and will get your work done.",4.0 out of 5 stars

4548,"My experience so far has been mostly great, but also bit not so in few cases. While I'm an iOS user for almost 10years, this is the first Mac I've ever laid hands on. The design and feel compared with other Laptops that I've used is beyond description. Clearly even before the Mac starts, one can just admire the look and feel. The screen quality is great. The trackpad works differently (but nicely) compared to a Windows laptop. Ofcourse one has to get used to few Mac specific keys, but in no time you can get started.Because of the 15"" screen, working with multiple windows is easier. Audio quality is good, and camera is also great.One experience that I have not enjoyed so much is the compatibility with McAfee products on Venture 13.5.1. Since I've bought a 3yrs licensce to protect my Mac, but due to some compatibility issue that McAfee is busy to fix for almost a week, I'm cnot using the Mac regularly.",5.0 out of 5 stars

It was clear by then that amazon is not going to take it back , the people at apple’s service centre were increasingly cooperative , they first insisted to put a new display but since the display was unavailable, they made it a CRU(customer return unit) and i got money back from APPLE , then i ordered a macbook pro from FLIPKART the best purchase at a good price",1.0 out of 5 stars

4590,"I got this action camera yesterday and to be frank ,I was kind of excited to check it out. Because procus is offering a lot with this action camera ,like two batteries and a bucket full of accessories.And that even for such a small price tag.#Unboxing It I received-----------------1xPROCUS RUSH Camera ,1x2.4G Remote Control ,2x1050mAh Battery ,1xWaterproof Case ,1xBicycle Stand , Mount ,2xClip, 1xHelmet Mounts 1xBandages ,5xTethers ,1xProtective Backdoor ,1xUSB Cable, 1xAC Charger, 1xLens Cloth, 1xManual ,1xAccessory Box#REVIEWING THE SPECs---------------------------Procus Rush is a 4K action camera with a 16MP sony CMOS sensor . It is mainly intended for sports usage and a few other applications like a helmet cam ,Diving cam etc.It comes with a 2"" LCD display and 170 degree wide angle lens. This camera comes with a 900mAh battery (as stated on the cover) which offers recording time upto 90mins. There are slots for MSD card ,charging ,HDMI.#DESIGN-------------This camera is very small ,you can easily hold it using your fingers. It is extremely portable. Just put it in your pocket and your are good to go. Even with the added waterproof casing it looks portable enough.I would highly recommend to keep the case applied always ,otherwise the lens will get damaged very easily .It already started attracting Oily fingerprints and smudges .Anyway you can easily clean it using the supplied soft clothThe design is very identical to the mighty GoPRO , and someone will surely mistaken this for a GoPRO ,for sure. The waterproof camera housing itself is very Rigid ,it uses a hard plastic material .#BUILD QUALITY-----------------------I would give 10/10 for build quality of the plastic housing . It is surely gonna withstand some rough abuse ,No matter how many times to open it ,or how many you move the mount ,it ain't gonna go faulty. Also the buttons are very stiff ,stiff to press ,but are surely durable.The camera unit is made of soft poly carbonate material but it isn't durable .The battery door itself is flimsy ,it already started bending and looks like it will get damaged very soon if I keep on switching batteries.Anyway the battery will stay in perfectly even without the door ,but only with the case applied .Anyway you should handle it with care and always keep the camera inside the case.#HOW TO GET STARTED ?Well ,the supplied user manual isn't anything useful. So I would let you know the basics.1- Press the power button for 3 sec for turning it ON .(Button is at the front)2-Press the shutter button on the top to snap pictures or start recording.3-Change the recording mode using the mode button (the front power button itself).4-That's enough , you will understand everything else by your own.Note: In menu mode ,the shutter button is the OK button.#CAM QUALITY:------------------------First of ,action cameras are made for outdoor usage .So these are perfect for outdoor shots but not good for Indoor.#Pictures:I snapped some selfies outside my house and found the images really wide .I mean it is really covering a lot of area. Its perfect if you want to take selfies with a lot of heads in the frame. Not just selfies ,other landscape images tuned out great. I mean these are surely not comparable to the expensive go pro ,but considering the cheap price tag ,its a really good bargain. Its very clear and quite accurate.You can easily change the resolution by going through the settings.#VIDEO : I have nothing to complain its more than usable. The 4k isn't anything to be exited about ,I found the 1080p exactly similar to the 4K one ,even though I run it on my 50inch TV. The difference is hardly noticeable .So I will only shoot in 1080p because the output is much more stable and smooth looking. If you are recording videos for more than 20mins itYou can change the resolution and the FPS very easily. 720p slow motion videos are also good.Amazingly the indoor slowmo videos are blur free .I tried recording my ceiling fan running at high speed ,still the video came out really smooth .Didn't expect that .If you are recording videos for longer sessions like more than 10 mins the camera will get little warm ,But don't worry It is fine .The display will turn off automatically to save power and to reduce the heating.Also the max recording time for 1080p on a single run is 15mins.#BATTERY LIFE-----------------------I didn't do an intensive battery test ,but from what I can remember ,I made 15 to 16 videos (1080p ,4k and 720 slow motion combined ,worth 50 mins) and some snaps . Still the battery level is at half. Well That's pretty great. I will update the actually battery review later.#WATERPROOFING---------------------------Keep the case on ,always !!Its completely waterproof ,You can dip it into a swimming pool ,river etc and it will work underwater flawlessly.Take it out in rain or just go put it inside your water tank it will still work.#REMOTE---------------Worked instantly ,no installation required. Very useful for selfies. :)CONCLUSION---------------------To be honest ,its a very good bargain for the price.As I said ,You get a lot for a very low amount ,considering that its an action camera. The final image quality is more than enough for the price.At the same price you are offered action cams from various other brands. Well I have been using procus products for a long time and I can assure you that their after sales service is great.So if you want to claim your 1 YEAR WARRANTY just give them a call.I do have loved an HDMI cable inbox ,for viewing in TV.Overall ,If you are in a budget and can't spend on expensive action cameras ,then go for Procus Rush.nOTE:: Camera samples will be uploaded in a couple of daysI hope you found my review helpful.

4592,"I bought this product in April earlier this year. Its an absolute waste of money. Here are a few detailed glows and grows for the product.Pros:1) The battery seemed to last for longer than what was mentioned, also the fact that you get two batteries is pretty neat.2) The carry case is pretty sturdy, and the accessories provided like mounts and straps are of good quality.Cons:1) The app is pathetic and never responds. If you want to rely on the app or control the camera using your phone then you will be very disappointed.2) The video quality is terrible, It is a very shaky and jumpy footage, the clarity in 4K is disappointing, I mounted it once on my bike and had a fairly good video, but on my recent trek the video was horrible. The memory card has remained the same (32GB, Class 10)3) The battery cover is really flimsy and broke the first time I opened it. Very cheap plastic. Now, every time I remove the camera from the case I have to be super careful as the battery case falls off.4) The remote stopped working during my last trip to Nepal in April, a week after I bought the product, last weekend on a short trek it was working again for a short while and then stopped again. so the remote isn't very reliable as well.5) Sound recording quality is horrible and you cannot attach an external mic, so it cannot be used to vlog.I was super excited about my trip to Nepal and thought of making some travel videos. I was warned not to buy the product by a few friends, but I went ahead and got it anyway after watching a few videos on youtube. A horrible investment. My suggestion is to be patient save a little more and buy a better camera. you wont regret the investment. I made a bad choice, please don't make the same mistake.PS: I will try and upload a few more videos on youtube in a while, and will update this review then.",1.0 out of 5 stars
4593," Pros:1. So many accessories in one package. As you can see in the attached image. (For other action cams you have to buy accessories additionally)💯2. Build quality is impressive. 📷3. Video recording with 1080p 60fps is great considering price tag. ✔️4. I love the Remote access feature which can be hooked along to your bike's key. 🔥5. Battery backup is nice.🔋6. It is nice that they have put ProcusCamera application for mobile devices. 📲Cons:1. It's great that they have provided an additional mic along with the package, but the output of the audio is really distorted. It would have been great if they could have provided the 2.5mm to 3.5 mm jack - so that we could use the other mics available in the market. But due to 2.5 jack limitations.... I'm only left with the limited option of using the provided mic only.🎤🔇2. Photo quality doesn't looks like it is taken with 16 MP.3. Image/Video Stabilization could be even better considering other option present in market but again if we look at it's price tag, it is ok types.4. They should work on color production up front - as it produces over exposed video output while on sunny/Bright days. Color wise image and videos looks flat. Also, this cam is not for you for recording videos at dim lights/evening light or at night as the video is almost blacked out with alot of noise.5. Please provide firmware upgrades. 🧑‍💻6. ProcusCamera application on Android does not work properly. The app crashes alot while transferring or viewing the captured video samples. Needs a dedicated user friendly application for sure. 📵With a little price hike nullifying above cons will be a great deal in this camera category.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Video recording with 1080p 60fps is great considering price tag.4. I enjoyed Time-lapse mode a lot.5. There should be an option to choose how much time you want it's screen to keep awake. You have to keep pressing buttons to check is it working or not.6. Battery backup is nice.7. It is nice that they have put ProcusCamera application for mobile devices.Cons:1. Confusing accessories count. They count each and every thing, we count differently2. Photo quality doesn't looks like it is taken with 16 MP.3.

Even if you download your videos on your device you don't see them in Camera roll, videos gets downloaded within the app itself and you can not enjoy outside their app.With a little price hike nullifying above cons will be a great deal in this camera category",3.0 out of 5 stars
4595,When I have purchased this product and have not heard the brand. Just got the product in the deal. Later I had detailed review in YouTube and explored procus site. If you try in indoor camera doesn't have great quality but not bad too as well. average quality and when you to take in good outdoor light and under water it performed well. Not great but still good worth for the money. I see mixed reviews but actually product is performing well with good battery backup and product accessories also seems to be good. when you use 4k quality battery drains bit quick. We have to play with the product and get use to it. If you are looking for budget version of GoPro. Procus Rush 3.0 is good option.,4.0 out of 5 stars
4596,"very smooth grip lightweight 4 k recording very clear. very handy, over all very good product I am reviewing this after using two or three months.",5.0 out of 5 stars
4597," First of all i would like to thank Procus Team for coming up with such a product at this price!Let me start off with the positives of the camera:1) Build of the camera and the provided accessories are of GOOD QUALITY!2) Easy to use buttons and 'click' sound on touch makes it intuitive.3) Daylight shots, both on 4k@30FPS and the 16M still image are impressive and i have not really felt the need of a seperate image stabilizer.4) The field of view on this lens is great! (I fit mine to the front of my motorcycle helmet and the view is good)5) Wtih a 64GB micro SD card and 2 1050mAH batteries, i could record a total of 5-6 hours, which is impressive for this camera!!Now, the negatives of the camera:1) The battery case cover is of very flimsy plastic. When using with my motorcycle gloves, i often felt like it was bending when i wanted to replace the batteries and put back the cover.2) Both, the mic and the speaker are average on this product. Though, i cant really complain much because of the price.3) Night shots are just okay. Lot of noise, especially in areas of very low lighting (When riding through lanes with less streetlights, i found a lot of noise and grainy quality. But shots on main roads and highways were great, so no worries.4) Not really sure if its just me, but my device does not record more than 15mins of video in one go. After 15mins, it starts recording again after about 1-2mins (I guess it processes the previous video until then).All in all, this product is a BANG FOR THE MONEY!!!!With about 23 mounts, waterproof housing, 2 batteries, a WIFI remote and carry case, this product is definitely worth the money!I wish the Procus team all the very best! Waiting for more products like these from you!(P.S. EXTERNAL MIC SUPPORT WOULD BE WELCOMED IN THE ""RUSH V 2.0"")",5.0 out of 5 stars
4598,"Good packaging, supplied with a carry case and lots of accessories(mounts for every situation), a remote and 2 additional batteries. Bought it while the introductory offer was bundles with it.Setting up the camera is easy, along with navigating through the different user modes and settings. The best part of this camera is the WiFi display through your phone using the XDV app.Currently using it on my helmet, the 3M sticky mounts given are strong and even at 180 km/h the camera is held properly with out any shakes! captures decent footage with an okay dynamic range. Too much difference in exposure leads to bright area and dull/dark spots, but video capture is not bad. The sony image sensor does a good job. There's 4k@30fps and 1080p@30fps or @60fps which good enough for everyday things and bike rides! Pictures turn out vivid, slo-mo shots at 720p@120fps is the main highlight of this camera.The only thing about this camera I didn't like was the fact that auto focus isn't present. It's a fixed focus camera. Since it's an action camera I don't things the main intention is to take macro shots, but it would have been nice to see auto focus.The lens offers an angle of 170° which is really wide!The camera can also be used as a dash camera on your car as it includes driving mode.Underwater shots with the included waterproof casing is possible!There's a remote given too, to start or stop video and take picturesOverall it's the best buy for the price range, as it has 4k WiFi slo-mo with remote control and it's 16M!",4.0 out of 5 stars
4599,"First of all the product was shipped very quickly as I was not expecting that fast in 3 days according to my location. The packing was ok or Good. As far as the product, I got all the accessories i.e 20+ accessories, but the down side of those are they are pretty cheap quality. The locking screws literally comes out of its black grip, over all its ok.The camera is Good, the quality of the video is also good as well as for the other functions. But the camera build is so cheap, like literally so cheap that a 10 year old boy can easily squeeze the product by his palm. As for battery, it is not that good or not that bad, if you are going to record a 2 hour continuous 4k video then you will need atleast 4 batteries. The camera heats up quickly when its in waterproof cover, so i recommend you to buy a non waterproof cover where air flow is there. The camera only supports high quality memory card class 10 U3, it supports cheap mermory card too but malfunction used to happen all the time and it Freezes your camera, so use the best SD card for batter performance.Lastly dont use this camera more then 7 to 8 months, by the looks of it, it wont last a year because of the build quality, performance and heating problem. This camera is good for newbies and starter definitely not for hardcore vloggers. Sell this camera after using for 6 to 7 months and upgrade to SJCAM or GoPro.",4.0 out of 5 stars
4600," I was initially skeptical about the product. I use the camera for my Biking and Road Trips. I needed something that would have minimal shake and have a good video recording quality at the same time. Of the options available, I had found that there existed very little difference in the products offered by Procus, SJCam and a couple of others. What made all the difference was that Procus offered me sufficient amount of Accessories and that there was an App that can control the camera functionality without me having to fiddle with the camera or the bluetooth remote that other camera's had offered. To all motovloggers out there, you all know how irritating it is to handle the camera while it is attached to the helmet. Now this app is pretty sweet and extremely handy. I have an old phone which I have deigned to use as a remote for the camera. Connect the camera to the Phone and Boom.... you're set for the ride.The App,The AccessoriesWhat I can only count as a negative on the Camera is the lack of external battery chargers and only 2 batteries. I wish Procus would sell additional batteries and also an external battery charger. (I have an alternative setup, that is more than helpful.)",4.0 out of 5 stars
4601,"*The product, procus rush (pro -5) is ok*It has not 4k/ultra HD quality and when we records on 4k or 1080p 60fps, it need suitable player to play on your computer/laptop/mobile*But only its 1080p quality (specially with 30fps) is superb and slow motion is ossum we can play it on any device smoothly(Very good)*We can connect procus rush camera to mobile with OTG or we can remove micro card and insert it on mobile and we can watch the footage.BECAUSE THE APP IS NOT WORKING*Camera is average (when we zoom the image, gets pixelated but if we don't zoom it, the image is fine)*Sound recording and quality is good*It has 170 degree wide-angle lens but it gives image/Video distortion.

4606,"I was in need of an action Camera to use it as a Dash cam & to record my trips as well. I was actually intended in getting a Go pro as I had a huge craze for it but I just came across this Action camera & driven by the High no of positive reviews I decided to make a purchase.Upon Recieving the product , It met all my expectations:The Image & Video Quality is Excellent in all the Resolutions n Videos Recoreded in Low light condtitions are good in higher resolutions .4K is simply great &the handy remote is Extremely useful.Moreover, it comes with tons of accessories which other Brands Don’t offer & thus adds great value to the purchase .The customer care is very Friendly & Prompt in answering your queries.But However, the Procus Rush App in Ios & Android is Extremely Sluggish, Unresponsive at times & your Recorded Videos of any Resolutions buffer a lot when you want to play it & this gets really annoying .I took this issue to this Customer care & they said they will look over it but they still haven’t solved the problem as of yet even after Sending all the recorded Videos to them having the buffer.Thus the lag still Persists in the App.Coming to the battery life,upon testing one of the two batteries I could just record upto 60 mts approx in 1080p resolution & I don't find that really Impressive.The Camera also Heats up when recorded for a long time but that doesn’t bother me much.So Overall, this a great Buy for beginners who are looking for a budget Friendly action Camera.The Various add-ons in the form of Extra batteries,Remote & Most Importantly the Carry case in which you can store all of the accessories that came with the camera are a major factor to chose Procus over other the others & Finally I would also like to Thank Procus for Saving me a lot of money.",5.0 out of 5 stars
4607," After doing an extensive research on all kinds of action camera in this budget range,I finally settled for Procus Rush 4k cam for my trip, where lots of water activities were pre-planned, and this cam didn't disappoint at all.PROs:-Underwater videos, Normal videos ,slow Mo videos, time lapse everything worked perfectly in all resolutions. Connecting it to mobile n controlling it via wifi is easy. Remote works absolutely fine. All mounts are trustworthy.Cons:-The only reason I didn't give it 5 star is becoz of its mic, though it does the job but I feel there is surely some room for improvement, I hope procus team does something about it. And low-light imaging n video may disappoint u.But hey, this is an action cam and at this price range I would definitely recommend it to any1.If u are reading this review, then go no further and buy this coz few days back I was in ur position too n bought this after covering all aspects. :)Cheers.",4.0 out of 5 stars
4608,"Received the product on time and in very good packaging.I love that Procus have put a lot of extra accessories, a sturdy hard carrying case and extra battery with the camera! You can see how clear the camera is. I bought this camera because I wanted an affordable action camera. Though GoPro camera are the first thing that come to mind when action cameras are discussed, they are super expensive compared to this. And the fact that they need to be imported with no customer support here in India only adds up to the cost. I am really glad I chose this little guy! I did a lot of research before buying this. I watched videos of people filming with this camera. For the price you can't beat this one.There are 20 accessories, a remote, a hard case, and an extra battery. This is like a complete package with almost all of the mounting options for an action camera that can possibly be there! That helps focus on getting all the kinds of shots that you want, without needing to worry about the how.Also, it has the following video modes - 4K 30FPS,2.7K 30FPS,1080P 60FPS,1080P 30FPS,720P 120FPS,720P 60FPS,720P 30FPS and up to 16 megapixel for photos. There is a settings panel where you can adjust these things as well as things like white balance.I am planning a trip to Himachal Pradesh this month and needed a camera that will withstand the water and be able to shoot action videos and photos and not have to worry about having my good camera ruined. I haven't clicked many pictures or movies yet, except to learn how to use it. I'll update the videos from my trip once I return!Hope this helped.",5.0 out of 5 stars
4609,"I ordered this camera for my Vlogs and videos on the go. Got the delivery in 2 days and I was excited to use it. So I am writing this review after using it for 1 week.BOX CONTENT* Procus Rush Camera* 22 Accessories from bike mount to helmet mount, car mount and much more.* Accessories Box to keep your things in order.* Water proof casing of the camera* 3 batteries one in camera, two in the boxAfter using for a week use my experienceBuilt quality is good and solid, even after 2-3 accidental drops, camera survived. Its size is so small, 2 inch in length and 1.5 in height and 1 inch is width. It have a LCD on back which works as a view finder. This cam is great for outdoor and traveling shooting while in daily life adventure, Vlogging, Motologging, underwater, kids slow motion and their activity recordings. Battery provided works for 1.5-2 hour depending upon the recording quality you choose. You can make slow motion and time lapse videos on this cam also. With the waterproof casing on it you can shoot some great under water shots and fun activities.Pros-1. Very Good 4k action camera in just price of 7000.2. Full of accessories, so dont have to buy anything separately.3. Waterproof mount have all the controls, no need to open again again.Cons1. LCD screen is not touch screen.2. Low-light photos and videos are a bit dark.3. Cannot be used as an alternative to DSLR as the quality of photos and videos are not for still photography.4. No a camera for youtubers, but definitely for Travel and vloggers.",5.0 out of 5 stars
4610,"First off, one must not compare this action camera to a GoPro. It has been a few months since I started using this camera. Aside from the battery door already being broken upon receiving, here are a list of Pros and Cons that I have come acrossPros:1. Footage quality is quite good.(Excellent for 1080p @ 60fps)2. There are a lot of accessories that comes with it.(I would recommend going for the set with the additional battery.)3. Battery lasts for an average of 1½ to 2 hrs(1080p @ 30fps)4. WiFi option to view live/recorded footages from a smartphone.5. It's so light weight, you sometimes forget it is already mounted.Cons:1. Build quality is a bit too flimsy2. Tends to shut down due to heating3. Aside from display, no audio indication to know whether it has begun or stopped recording.4. There is a bit of a lag in the WiFi connection.5. When switching batteries, the date resets.(May be an issue for vloggers when organising the logs on day to day basis)6. No external battery charger available, yet.",4.0 out of 5 stars
4611,So I bought this camera to record my mountain bike journeys. See the 1st problem which I faced was that this camera has 0 stability. I could have bought a normal camera and it would have the same stability. Most people don't even have 4k displays so there's no point investing in 4k quality you guys should have gone for 1920 ' 1080 quality and better stability cause thats what I want in my budget action camera . This is great for scuba diving id say but not for adventures .,3.0 out of 5 stars
4612,Pros:1. EIS works superb2. Battery life is more than expected3. So many accessories make camera practical4. Quality in day time is superb5. Multiple shooting modesCons:1. Mic is of no use if you are using for motovlogging2. Average video quality at night time3. Video size is very large for the quality. Can capture 4 hrs on 59GB with 1080p 60fps. Can capture 34 minutes on 15GB with 4K 60fps,5.0 out of 5 stars
4613,"Bought the Procus Rush 4K Action Camera from Amazon @ 7200/- on Diwali sale. First of all good packing and fast delivery by Amazon. I would say this is a great camera with this price range. You will be getting around 23 accessories including 2 batteries, remote and various clips for hooking up the camera and lot more. Pretty good quality in daylight on 1080P 60FPS. Camera works great on motion and time lapse recording. I am using XDV app for both my android and iOS phone which is connecting well and will be able to see the live view and can change the settings also will be able to view and download recordings and snapshot. Bought a class10 micro SD card of 64GB, which is recommended for 4K recording. I took some sample videos in both 4K and 1080P 60FPS. Its better to record in 1080P 60FPS than 4K for satisfying video clarity and to save storage. Great clarity in daylight using the 1080P. Low light usage will be bit dissatisfying. Slow motion and time lapse is also working great. Also put the camera in water for some time just to check the waterproofing ability and its like a WAW. Waiting to explore it more and will update you all.The camera is slightly getting heat while charging, i think its quite normal and OK. But, could have given a separate battery charger for the easy charging, the only option we have is now to put the batteries inside the camera itself for charging. Which is a BIG drawback. Display is not up to mark but still feel like its enough and ok. Rest all is impressive, picture quality, setup, usage. Highly recommended for all who looking for a good action camera with this price range. Go For It Guys.",5.0 out of 5 stars
4614,"Procus Rush is a good action camera. The clarity with Full HD video is pretty good. Most suited for bright light videography. Low light videos and photos has grains. As the camera is designed to have a wide angle coverage, the close angle videos, is a bit curved. Does not give a natural feel. It would have been good if the camera adjusts its focal length depending on if it's a closed shot or an outdoor wide angle shot. Best suited for taking scenery out doors. Underwater video is pretty good. There are host of accessories provided and we are clueless about many of them for what they are used and how to best use them. I understand from Procus executive that they are in the process of doing a video explaining the accessories and how to use them. That would be a good addition. Battery back up is decent. Only thing is it's a take a long time to charge. But it's manageable if you can plan it well . At this price it's value for money.",4.0 out of 5 stars
4615,"At the price it is at, it is a value for money proposition. Good video quality but i felt that the image stabilization could have been slightly better, especially for the bike riders, however i think if used on a car it should be fine.Overall a good product..... Must buy for all the vloggers.",4.0 out of 5 stars
4616,"Seemed like a pretty good deal, going by the price it is offered at. I'm listing my observations after a year of use :(i) Lots of accessories. A good carrying case. Camera looks premium.(ii) It supports 1080p HD recording with inbuilt slow motion mode.(iii) Good seal even after submerging the camera (with case) approx 1 feet inside water. Not a single drop found inside.(iv) Video recording is decent at least. Don't expect viewable results in low light. Zero stabilization.Occasionally the video doesn't record or stops automatically after a couple of minutes. That is irritating and I cannot rely on the camera to record weddings or important events.(v) Photo quality is decent in lit conditions. Okay for social media. Quality is nowhere near a DSLR, so better not to compare any further.(vi) Customer service is okayish.(vii) Battery is a real bummer. Barely last 3 hours.(viii) Build quality is not really that good. One of the volume/zoom buttons on the right got caved inside within the first 6 months of use. Customer service wasn't of much help in the first try, and I couldn't make time later due to exams & interviews, so it's still like that. Usable definitely, but you need to apply extra pressure to get the button to work.Overall verdict : Buy only if you're stripped of funds and if there aren't any better options in your budget. Else, save and buy a GoPro.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Can be used underwater (both video and photography)2. It includes more than required mounts so can be attached to any surface.3. One can also use with the wifi. So it also works as a hidden one .4. Video quality is quite good when watched in laptop or some other device.5. Includes slow motion, time lapse etc.CONS:1. Sound quality is very poor but only if u hear the sound in the cam itself.

4620,"I have not been able to locate an action camera that delivers so much at this price.I had bought a VR set from Procus and that was of high quality so I reposed my faith again by buying this camera.Yes, the frugal price is reflected in the slightly low grade plastic material. Specially the battery cover which looks like it will need very careful and delicate handling to prevent it from snapping into two, specially where the tang slides into the body to fit it over the battery compartment.The various accessories are fine. One can register the device on the Procus website by entering the unique product number. This will help in warranty issues.The Procus app is just superb save for one aspect. One has to connect the camera on WiFi to the fone by accessing the Procus Wifi spot thru the Wifi settings of the fone and not thru the app. Once that is done, connection is established immediately. The deficiency is that there is no way to keep a copy of the foto or video on the fone. If only this facility is activated by Procus, the app will also get 5 stars and more. This app is crucial to align the camera at exactly the correct elevation and azimuth when mounted on the helmet. Nobody else but the app can do it perfectly.My verdict? A perfect camera at this price for the beginner moto or aqua or sky vlogger. You want higher quality of everything? Then get the GoPro series else this is sufficient for most needs",5.0 out of 5 stars
4621," Bought this camera and wasn’t really expecting a lot from it..especially 4K quality..but to be honest, it exceeded my expectations (especially the 1080p mode)..used it for a good two hours and even made a couple of videos and the performance of this camera was above average! I’m yet to see what it films like when I go for sky diving (trust me I will) but the footage that I’ve already got on this camera speaks for itself...Yes there are some flaws in it…(like the 4K is not the real 4K obviously), but the output on a class 10 memory card is pretty amazing for all modes. Slow motion and timelapse are simply kickass and I think in this price range this camera is slayin it..I recently went to Kolkata and had some time to kill so I made a vlog using this camera which I’ve also attached in the review..Hope it helps all those out there who are still in a quandary as I’ve used all the modes of this camera in the video..but believe me I know what I paid for and I got what I wanted..rest is your decision..I’m thinking of shooting a dance video using this camera coz I wanna see if this can fulfill my requirement in that area too and I might just upload that video in my review as well..",5.0 out of 5 stars
4622,Pros:1) PRICE of Action Camera with Accessories is USP2) Offered with so many Accessories3) Decent Cover for Action camera and accessories at this price point.4) Can expect good service.5) External MIC provided in package that's important for action camera.Cons:1) Ok Image Quality2) Battery life could have been better3) You cannot connect any external MIC as it's not 3.5 jack. So you have to rely on provided MIC.,4.0 out of 5 stars
4623,I purchased it for moto vlogging and my budget wasn't too high. I got to know about Procus Rush 2.0 and it is the best camera under this price category.

4625,"This camera comes with lot of accessories but lacks severely in its performance.1. The quality of the photos is worse. My 13Mp mobile camera shoots better photos than this camera.2. The quality of 4k videos is good, but I can't really judge as I have not used any other camera to record 4k videos. It seemed fine, but the battery consumption is equally high in 4k video mode.3. The app provided for this camera is so premature and lacks basic functionality. This was the major turn off for me. College students in their free time build better apps than this. Procus should really fix this.4. You can only view the latest 8 photos/videos when connected to the camera in app. And it won't even play the videos that I recorded. The only way I could watch the videos was after I transferred the files to my PC or in the camera itself without proper audio.5. Once you have connected to camera in the app, your camera will only display the WiFi information (pic attached) and you can't go ahead and click photos. To do so, you have point the camera and check in your phone for what it's shooting and than click. It's troublesome.6. They have mentioned 23 accessories, but they have counted even the wrist band for camera and wiping cloth as an accessory which was completely not necessary and premature.7. Only a couple of minutes after I received it and I was exploring the options. And bamm!! It hangs. Check the photo attached. The app provided hangs a lot too.8. My requirement was to use this camera while riding, click lot of photos and for timelapse. This camera seems to satisfy only one of my requirement and that too only for couple of hours if iam recording in 4K. Returned it.9. If you're going to buy it even after this explanation, go for the one with extra battery. You'll thank me later.",1.0 out of 5 stars
4626,"This is the first action camera we have bought. It was a gift for my 10 yr son. With that perspective it has been an amazing purchase. We have traveled to Sikkim, Arunachal and Meghalaya and used it as a dashcam as well as underwater.The timelapse is good as well as videos in 1080p. Photos not as good as my smartphone but that is understandable. Bty life is decent and the spare bty ensured that 5hr time lapse videos possible. Will upload videos and snaps shortly.User interface is decent and the mob app is just ok..lots of glitches. My son is able to use it easily.Final Verdict:- it's not a GoPro..but definitely worth the price. Consider it as a stepping stone to a costlier model. This way u will get familiar with the working of an action cam as well as realise whether you are really interested in making such an investment.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I could use itanywhere and everywhere, whether underwater, strapped to my bike, it did it’s bit. The best part is all the accessories are provided for, so you are ready to go from the time the shipment arrives at your place.I was able to capture some amazing videos and pictures with this camera. Be it the colour variations during sunsets or different hues of blue underwater, the camera proved its mettle.Just a couple of things that they should work on:• tends to heat up when it is in the waterproof case• the pictures and video get a bit grainy when you zoom• performance could get better in low light conditionsIn all, an absolute value for money product and I would recommend every budding photographer to go for it.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Great option for beginners.",5.0 out of 5 stars
4630,"Product is not as good as expected reading the reviews and watching few online YouTube reviews. We use camera mainly for taking good quality photos/videos. Hoping the same, I purchased the camera especially for my trip to Finland recently. Before traveling, I called service centre numerous times for extra battery as they had provided just 2 batteries. But was not provided the same. I even agreed on collecting it from their Chandigarh office but that was not sorted. And when I did travel, I faced battery issue. I was recording my skiing video in time lapse but the battery soon went dead without me realising it. It was really bad to realise later that the video was just recorded for few minutes.On coming back from my trip, I transferred all the video to my computer hoping for a nice quality (based on previous reviews). It was really disappointing to see blurry videos.I received a call later from their call centre asking me about product review and to leave an Amazon comments. I told all the above to the call centre and in response they told me that at this budget price, I will receive this much quality only.All in all just okay camera. I wish someone had told me earlier only that at this budget price I will receive a just okay camera, I would have made a proper learned decision before only and not just going by other product reviews which I now assume could be fake.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I'd recommend a normal entry level dslr or a simple point and shoot. This action cam is recommended for entry level videographers (not photographers)If you are just starting and trying your hand on videography go for it, without a doubt this is the best in this range.I'll use it on a trek and upload the video link here.In case you have any doubts contact me on Instagram at @abhimanyu69Thank you.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Moving further, remote is functional and is very handy. The only thing which I didn’t found good was its video quality and thus returned it.

Both battery are very loose in camera so they shake and camera get off while recording in shaky conditions like riding.2. WiFi connection is not so stable if you keep your mobile data network on then connect with camera Wi-Fi is really irritating it continuously getting hang and WiFi connection speed is very slow around 1.5 Mbps while it goes very fluctuate.3. Video lag- During recording I found video lag in many times. I record a 18 minutes video and there was 6 minutes length of video was useless because of buffer, lagging and crop frame.4. Screw size- screws holders are a bit big they create problem with waterproof casing.5. Biggest issue it is not true 4K at 4K record it record about 2k and at 720p it records only 480p quality compare to a 10000₹ smartphone camera.6. No option available for shutter speed and ISO during photo and photo quality is not upto mark.This camera claimed it has SONY imx image sensor but true I don't have it.Casing and accessories material quality is good.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Two batteries can take you any where all over day. Along with this bunch of accessories never give you chance to feel of anything missing. Not even a minor issue or problem i have faced since i got this. Only one scope of improvement i would like to share is in the Speaker quality, need to improve the speaker quality a little bit, otherwise best combo package in a ultimate best budget.

During live communication through the mobile app, I found that the audio was clear and easily understandable in quiet indoor settings. However, in environments with background noise or larger rooms, the volume might not be loud enough to have a conversation effectively.The camera's motion detection capabilities work impressively well.

This also has coloured night video capturing functionality, basically it has inbuilt leds light which turns on in dark.. Night Vision setting of auto, turns on the led whenever it detects motion at night. Another indirect advantage of this mode, this camera can be used as motion sensing light..

4655,"I was going on a 15 day long trip and had to keep our cat at home - with a maid taking care of him for 1 hour daily. But for the rest of the day we'd be terrified of what our cat would be doing alone and so I ordered this camera. Now there are much cheaper ones available on the market including from Godrej - but this one had the best reviews. So I didn't do too many calculations and went with this.And boy was my decision correct!!! The camera offers exceptionally high quality feed - and any time my cat moved - it would notify me with a live view of what the cat was doing.I have tested this in night also and still the feed is exceptionally high quality. I'd say if you are buying this camera for something important, then definitely dont try to save that money dont go for cheaper cameras on the market. This one is definitely worth it.BUT:a. Motion Tracking: The camera offers motion tracking wherein it will follow a moving object (with its 180 degree swivel). But this motion tracking sucks!! Given the premium charge on the camera - it shouldn't suck this bad but even if the object is moving in one line in the forward direction the camera will jerk backwards 2-3 times in 10 seconds giving a very bad motion tracking experience.b. iPhone Setup Issue: I used my iPhone SE 2020 to setup this camera and after 50 attempts (I have even posted a question here on the amazon QnA) I couldn't set it up. Which made me think the camera is defective or Im doing something wrong. But when I tried on an android device it setup in an instant. Literally an instant. May be it was a problem with my particular iphone model, but I am pretty technically savvy and I still couldnt figure out how to set it up on my iphone.

Can share the camera via app to other mobile devices where they should have Mi home app.9. Can be installed up side down, and the camera view can be rotated via app settings.10. Has desktop app which can be downloaded from official MI site.Bad:1. No free or paid cloud STORAGE in India (Should have reduced the price). Only NAS and SD card storage available.2. Night vision doesnt automatically turn OFF even though settings has been updated.3. No proper updates to firmware (May be MI stopped supporting these devices)4. Laggy desktop app5. Motion detection is buggy. Detects flying flies or some flying objects as person and sends notification. Think how it will be when notification popups at midnight and sends PERSON DETECTION notification. When you try to view, there wont be any person. May be it detects Ghost :/6. Once detected a person or motion, it captures 10 seconds preview.7. SD storage upto 32gb which recorded 4 days of continuous recording. Didn’t try 64gb.Packaging:Secured packaging, but the product manufactured was last year.Tips/Note:Connect the MI security camera to powerbank. Then from powerbank to power adapter.

4747,"I recently purchased the Xiaomi 360° Home Security Camera 1080p 2i, and overall, I'm quite impressed with its performance. This camera offers a great range of features and functionality that make it a valuable addition to any home security setup.One of the standout features of this camera is its 360-degree viewing capability. With the ability to rotate the camera lens in all directions, I can easily monitor my entire room without any blind spots. The image quality is excellent, providing clear and crisp 1080p resolution footage. I appreciate the wide-angle lens that captures a broader field of view, ensuring I don't miss any important details.Setting up the camera was a breeze thanks to the user-friendly mobile app provided by Xiaomi. The app allows for easy pairing with the camera and provides a seamless experience for accessing the live feed, adjusting settings, and reviewing past recordings. The camera also supports two-way audio communication, enabling me to speak with people on the other end of the camera through the app, which is a convenient feature.The camera's night vision capabilities are impressive. Even in low-light conditions, I can still see a clear image, which is crucial for maintaining security during nighttime hours. The motion detection feature works reliably, sending timely notifications to my smartphone whenever movement is detected within the camera's field of view. It gives me peace of mind, knowing that I will be alerted if there's any suspicious activity.One area where the Xiaomi 360° Home Security Camera could be improved is its cloud storage options. While the camera supports local storage via a microSD card, it would have been nice to have a more robust cloud storage solution for added convenience and peace of mind. However, considering the affordable price point of this camera, it's a minor drawback.In terms of build quality, the camera feels sturdy and well-made. The design is sleek and blends well with my home decor. The camera's compact size makes it easy to position in various locations around the house. Additionally, the camera's motorized pan and tilt function operate smoothly and quietly.Overall, the Xiaomi 360° Home Security Camera 1080p 2i is a reliable and feature-packed device that provides excellent value for the price. Its 360-degree rotation, high-quality video resolution, and night vision capabilities make it a top contender in the home security camera market. While the cloud storage options could be improved, it remains a solid choice for anyone looking to enhance their home security setup. I highly recommend this camera for its affordability and performance.",4.0 out of 5 stars
4748,"I highly recommend this camera to parents who leave their children at home. The video and sound quality are exceptional; you can hear conversations clearly. However, the voice clarity when using the app to talk is not as good. Additionally, it automatically reconnects to Wi-Fi after a power failure.",4.0 out of 5 stars
4749,This camera is easy to install and operate. The picture quality is very clear and sharp. Justifies the HD tag. The app is easy to operate. Two way communication is clear and loud. One can use it for talking as well. Another best feature is that it can connect with your Alexa and display the video on Echo Show screen.Deducting only 1 start as this does not have automatic tracking feature which a Yi camera has. It follows body movement if set to a auto tracking mode. This one has to be rotated manually if you are on remote location.Might be a possibility that this feature may come in an app update.,4.0 out of 5 stars

4753,"Best video quality 2k pixels, best product to buy worth for money easy installation good performance",4.0 out of 5 stars
4754,"The camera is ok. I am running a 64 GB card which backs up approximately a week's worth of footage. Installation and setup was easy, just needs a stable wifi. Can cover a wide area with 360° rotation and field of view is good too. I am getting notifications too about events unlike many others. The quality is decent but that's about it for its features.Now for the issues-1. I chose this over its competitors due to NAS but it's just a gimmick. My laptop, phone and all other devices can recognise my NAS but this camera couldn't. I tried all tricks in the book(rather the internet) but it just couldn't recognise my NAS.2. Other cameras has motion/subject tracking, this doesn't.3. It doesn't recognise half of the activities. I have it faced at the entry gate of my house. It gives notification about some random activity where some pixel has changed but half of the activities happening right infront of it isn't recognised. I have passed so many times infront of it, even faced it, but it only captured my activity once. Its activity recognition is not to be dependent upon, you would have to review your footage manually.4. If you have to download a portion of the video to your local device, you have to press the record button while running the footage and then let it run at 1X. I can't just point it to the first and last point on the timeline and let it finish NOOOOO, you can't even speed up the footage while ""recording"", you would have to sit there and wait for the footage you've reviewed 10 times to record again.5. The camera quality is not very good. The picture is grainy and not very clear. The quality (if judged by the resolution) is better on the realme cam at the same price.6. The playback at 16X sometimes is very jittery. It gets stuck so much that it renders that feature completely useless sometimes but other times works fine.7. Oh and good forbid you lose your internet connection, it'll stop recording altogether. I had my internet go out for a couple of hours but I thought that it might be writing that data on the SD card since writing there won't require any internet connection. When the internet connected again, the footage of that time was just missing. WHY?8. This is just a minor bug that the camera calibration button in the app has no confirmation message. If you accidently press it, it'll just start calibrating. There should be a confirmation popup on it like we have on delete.There might be some other issues which I'm forgetting but this is the crux of it. I wish I had purchased the realme cam but I can't say for sure if that would not have these or some other issues.",3.0 out of 5 stars

4763,Fitted two in my home at Kolkata. Viewed the video from MUMBAI and PUNE without any issue. Pro : connects well with network. Night vision is quite clear. Video colour is good in bright light. Slow movement is OKCons : Colour is lost in low light level. Can't delect fast movement becomes blurred in fast movement. Video colours losses with light levels. Picture becomes blurred in enlargement. Sound level is low and cracks.Otherwise it performs well. But can get security camera much cheaper search on line well before buying. Better go Amazon Basic one which is much cheaper and performs as well as this product.,3.0 out of 5 stars
4764,It was my mistake that I confused human detection with tracking. For the price you are getting this for lack of this one feature is complete turn off for me atleast. Bought this to track babies at home when I am away at work. But i can't keep moving the camera so it's inconvenient.Only thought of buying this as review of picture quality was better and I presumed( for unknown reasons) that it will have motion tracking feature at this price.Hope this helps someone who is looking for similar features like me.Complete waste of money for me.,3.0 out of 5 stars
4765,The product works like a charm however the product supports 64 GB of storage instead of 32 GB as mentioned in the product description. It is a plus but can mislead customers to buy a lower storage memory card when they can enjoy 7 day s of recording instead of 3 days.,4.0 out of 5 stars

It records 1080p video which looks clear even in low light conditions.It also have the event detection feature which records videos when some movement is detected and the best part is that the video clips are stored in cloud for later viewing. I will buy a couple of more cameras to cover my whole house.Only one thing which I didn't like was that the camera which I received was a used unit as the seal on the packaging was broken (see picture) and camera has to be reset to be used for the first time.Don't buy from this seller but buy this camera even if it is a bit expensive.

4789,I am using this product for few months now. I must say this CCTV is the most stable and durable camera I have ever used. I also own 2 more camera from Xiaomi and so it's easier to manage all 3 from 1 single mobile App. Quality of video is good. Low light recoding is decent. FOV is best and the fact that you can rotate the camera from app is the best feature. This camera also supports NAS storage so if you are planning to ditch SD card recording then this is the one you should buy.

As long as you have WiFi connectivity it is fantastic.Only minor gripe is if you shift locations (WiFi networks), setting it up is a pain because you have to reset the device each time (press a super tiny button for 5 seconds) and do the configuration every time.It would be nice if they allowed the app to allow the camera to connect to different WiFi networks (one at a time is enough) without resetting the entire device every time.Other than that, this is absolutely perfect for its price.

4862,"EDIT after 1.5 years of 24x7 usage============================Still going strong! Never failed even once. Happy that my sd card is still functional too. The camera is placed outside in a a shade, for details please refer to the review below.EDIT after 7 months of 24x7 usage=============================The camera still works great. It has been deployed in my (covered) porch outside in Rajasthan from the day I bought it, so it faces dust and weather abuse (temperature 1-2deg in winters, ~50deg in summers). I thought of testing its outdoor capabilities, although it is stated that this is an indoor cam. It is behaving pretty well till now, nothing out of place or different than when this guy was new. Upcoming scortching summers will test it inside out, and if it stays stable throughout, I am getting 3-4 more for coverage! I somehow didn't get this level of reliability and features in any outside-rated cam available.===========================================Just received and my God! What a little beast it is. Loads of features in this negligible amount Motion detection (3-level sensitivity adjustment), custome pan/tilt positions, camera sharing, night vision, alarm system, near 360 pan, great fov, decent 1080p, recording on phone (haven't tested sd-card thing, but it is said that it supports that too). Configuring was a breeze. It also has both speaker and microphone, so you can speak something 'into' the camera from wherever you are, and obviously can hear from the camera too. Both these things work decently, I've tested their stability well.Most important thing, its completely hassle free, install and forget thing. Once configured, if the power goes off, it'll be ready for use, auto-connected to wifi once power is back (I know its an obvious requirement, but still I loved that). You can use the app to see the live feed & record on your phone itself (in addition to sd card in the cam) anywhere in the world, and pan/tilt remotely. I've played with almost every feature and let me tell you, its a serious deal. Build quality could use some more thoughts, but this is supposed to be used inside. Looks are great. Also the alarm sound levels are just average, but again its just an added feature and decent enough to place the creeping elements in a puddle of confusion. For alarm, it can also blink a pretty bright white LED near the camera lens, along with sound.Only thing that remains to be seen is its 24x7 performance and durability. I've put it on duty, and will update this review after a month or so.",5.0 out of 5 stars

You can only format the whole SD card at once.There are better cameras with better apps. Go with another brand like Mi or HikVision",2.0 out of 5 stars

You can confirm this by Playing back the video from the EzyCam app.",5.0 out of 5 stars

4935,"Reviewing after using for a month. I purchased CP-E25A to use as a surveillance camera. I fitted this in the sit out to watch the gate. I installed a 64GB Sandisk ultramicro SDXC along with it. With 64Gb it can store one month's videos in SD format. After one month of use, I can confirm this camera is value for money. Sound capturing does not seem much good. Motion detection is good but motion tracking is not much effective (maybe it is not designed for the purpose I use). If motion tracking is enabled, the camera will not return back to the original set position if it failed to track the object it was tracking. So if motion tracking is enabled, the camera will be positioned in some other direction and not at the place I set to watch for. I did not try two way talking feature. The app quite is good at managing the device. But I could not find a way to share screenshots ( it takes during motion detection enabled ) in bulk. We can share each image one by one though.",5.0 out of 5 stars

The installation is very easy ( but have tool to attach it on wall like drill etc). Wifi is required to for enable this camara function ( if there is power cut or wifi trip on that time it will not record any thing). However once it is connected you can access it with ur mobile network from anywhere. This has limitation that can make one admin and 3 more person can share this .Apart from admin rest will have view access only. Account setup is easy. It has memory card slot .I have ised 256 gb. It has cloud facility as well depends on u completely whether u want to avail it or not. Once camera is installed ,you will not have to to any thing..it will automatically move and focus one particular place from where people may come usually like life or lobby. Once it detect any movement it will move according to motion of that object and focus on that. There is no problem so far and it is working fine so far . This product can be considered if you are looking for AI+ SMART camera. I m not much technical but I tried to put the experience accordingly. Thank you.",5.0 out of 5 stars

As of it's features I seems the best at it's price range, though I wish it had a bigger speaker and multiple mics as the call quality isn't up to the mark like xiomi cams. Connection is pretty solid and it also broadcasts an rspt stream over port 554. I took it apart and the internals are pretty simple with a realtek rts3903 SOC and 2 bipolar steppers and a 1/2.8 3MP sensor which shoots in 2304×1296,15fps. The video feed can be accessed remotely through the tapo app and it's completely free to use.

It doesn't cut even if you compress in between windows.The company wont provide memory card in the pack. I bought 256 GB separate memory card which give back up of 21 days. After 21 days, you dont need to remove card, it automatically rewrites the data.

5001,"I found this camera is best. It has 2.7K resolution 720P and 1080 P resolution option. whichever you want you can record. The best part is motion sensor is very efficient It will detect 2 type of motion sensor. NON person Motion detection and PERSON motion detection. Any small movement it will capture and send an notiifcation to your mobile. If you are at home. you need to connect to same network. and if you are outside or travelling or staying outside you can still monitor using your mobile data internet.It has inbuilt mic and speaker, But speaker output is not much loud. Just a manageble. this is bit challenging,you can use this one for below options.1. If you want to monitor a baby or KID2. Can monitor your OLD Age members.3. You can fix this all around the home with multiple camera and interface with single APP on mobile. you can watch. The APP has capacity of 32 screens it means, you can attach 32 cameras connect to single camera.This required normal Micro USB cable which is come along with box and only need a power point where you want to install the camera. All these camera can be connected to single wifi network. like if you have dual band wifi router (2.4GHz and 5GHz) then it is better to connect 2.4Ghz. all camera.Micro SD card you can insert and take recording. Depending on the resolution the time like will be recorded and it is cyclic recording. 21 to 30 days of recording. after 31st days.. it wil erase the 1st day recording it does orverwrite ... looping basically.it is 360 rotating feature. all the movements can be captured.. and Mic is powerfull all the sounds will be captured. its great.overall it is serves my purpose 5 star",5.0 out of 5 stars

5024,"Though the camera successfully establishes a connection with the WiFi router, but it encounters a recurring issue of disconnection and subsequent reconnection every 10-15 seconds. This problem, however, does not manifest when linked to an alternative WiFi router. Regrettably, the root cause of this behavior remains elusive despite my efforts. Regrettably, the customer support provided no resolution, and it appears many other users are grappling with identical concerns.The camera curiously vocalizes the phrases ""disconnected from WiFi"" and ""connecting to WiFi"" each time it establishes or re-establishes its connection. This quirk is somewhat perplexing, given the desire for discreet security camera operation. A simple in-app notification would suffice in this regard. There is no way you can mute this announcement.Although equipped with motion tracking capabilities, the camera's performance in this area leaves much to be desired. Notably, it does not consistently return to its original position once movement ceases, prompting me to disable this feature via the app.Additionally, an unsettling occurrence transpired over the past two nights, wherein the camera autonomously adjusted its position slightly. Consequently, the recorded footage proved futile until manually restored to its initial orientation. Such behavior is entirely unacceptable.Regrettably, the camera's night vision capabilities fall short of expectations. The resulting imagery is marred by excessive graininess and a lack of digital noise reduction (DNR). Nighttime video quality appears lackluster and is exclusively viable within confined spaces or when supplemented with additional lighting. It is essential to note that outdoor use, even in shaded areas, is not advised due to the camera's lack of weatherproofing.The camera's remote repositioning via the app yields instantaneous physical movement of the lens. However, the accompanying video feed experiences significant lag, rendering precise control via the app challenging.Establishing a connection to the video stream proves inconsistent, characterized by laggy performance and an approximate 50% success rate. Subsequently, repeated attempts are often necessary via the app to achieve a successful connection.Last but not the least...the camera stopped working within 6 months of use and the customer care is of no use. Service center in Kerala is at Kochi and I have to spend more money to repair than the cost of the camera. So now I am using this as dummy camera.My sincere advice, please do not by this brand.... there are many brands who give replacement guarantee for 2 yrs... this camera is not worth. They have very few service centers and they refuse to replace",4.0 out of 5 stars
5025,"I have purchased a number of CP Plus CP E31A and CP E41A, but I am hesitant to give this product a good score. For the price it is offering during discounts, I think it is very decent.I have acquired a number of the 3MP model and the 4 MP CCTV model as well. Some of the items were working excellently, in daylight and in the dark. The night vision IR also works excellent with clear images. Some of the units had blurry and soft areas in the video. It was not usable at night, (This is not a dirty lens issue and firmware issue). Some units were working fine when taken out of the box with clear sharp images but then again became blurry and had soft areas after a few days.So, my suggestion to anyone buying this is to have a little bit of patience and test the unit, and leave it ON for a night. Do not damage the packaging soon, if you buy a unit that is working fine with clear sharp video on all areas during the day and at night, congratulations. But, please check the unit and test it for some time and see whether you need to replace the item or not. Out of the 10 nos. I have acquired, around 4 nos. were unsatisfactory (1 no. Was not usable at night, 2 (two) 4MP versions had soft areas, and 1 (one) 3MP version had soft areas.",3.0 out of 5 stars

5030,"The camera has lot of issues which outweighs its features.1. It connected to the WiFi router, but the WiFi disconnects every 10-15 seconds and reconnects again. The issue is not there when connected to a different WiFi router. Couldn't find the reason why this happens. I have 98% signal in the camera. Customer care wasn't any help. I can see that a lot of people have the same issue.2. The camera announces ""disconnected from WiFi"" and ""connecting to WiFi"" everytime it connects. This is weird, because we don't want others to know that the security camera is disconnected. An app notification is all that is required.3. This camera has motion tracking, but it seems not working correctly. The camera doesn't always go back to its original position after the movement stops. Hence I've disabled this feature in the app.4. Also, the camera is changing its position slightly for 2 days at night. So the footages are useless until it is manually moved back to the initial position. This is totally unacceptable behavior.5. Night vision is too bad. It is grainy. Looks like it doesn't have DNR / digital noise reduction. Video is also dull at night. It is usable only if used in a small room, or there is some light. If used outdoors (Use under the shade. Its not weather proof), turn on some light throughout the night. Otherwise night vision will be too dark and dull.6. Moving the camera position from the app instantly moves the camera lens. But the video has a lot of lag and it is difficult to control it from the app.7. Connecting to the video stream is laggy and it connects to the camera half of the time. Other time, we have to try again from the app.So far all Cons. Now the pros are:1. It has good day time vision. It is excellent for the price for daytime use. No issues during the day.2. The motion detection notifications are good. We can see snapshots of the motion detection alerts. This is beneficial since we can see who or what moved in the camera field of view without playing each motion detection video. A quick glance can give a lot of information. I own Tapo cameras which gives this feature only with their paid subscription.3. This camera has LAN port, unlike other turret cameras in this price range.4. The camera has ONVIF support, so it can connect to NVR. (I haven't tested this feature yet).I own and also have shared multiple Tapo security cameras and they all were pretty good. Bought this CP Plus camera for someone else because of the price, features and the brand value, but the software issues made the user experience too bad. The issues make this camera unreliable and unusable for me.",2.0 out of 5 stars

5143,"Reviewing after using for a month. I purchased CP-E25A to use as a surveillance camera. I fitted this in the sit out to watch the gate. I installed a 64GB Sandisk ultramicro SDXC along with it. With 64Gb it can store one month's videos in SD format. After one month of use, I can confirm this camera is value for money. Sound capturing does not seem much good. Motion detection is good but motion tracking is not much effective (maybe it is not designed for the purpose I use). If motion tracking is enabled, the camera will not return back to the original set position if it failed to track the object it was tracking. So if motion tracking is enabled, the camera will be positioned in some other direction and not at the place I set to watch for. I did not try two way talking feature. The app quite is good at managing the device. But I could not find a way to share screenshots ( it takes during motion detection enabled ) in bulk.

5190,"Posting this review after using a week. It is worth buying.Initially faced difficulties in setting the camera and connection establishment.Cable length is about 6 feet.As it mentioned it's rotate 360° perfectly.Motion detection is also perfect.Night vision picture quality is average.Picture quality is good when area is fully illuminated with lights, else overall picture quality is good. Smart tracking works good.You can share this device up to total 06 persons.Two way communication is not so good.Mobile application is also good but use of PAN AND TILT option is taking time to take in effect.Some times Camera missed recording of motion and Human detection.It works only on 2.4GHz network.Ethernet port is given for wired network.To operate this camera you must have strong 2.4 GHz network.It does not work well on mobile data network as it laps frequently and taking time to load live and recording.If you don't have Internet than still camera records, recording stored in SD card.Once you connect the internet, you can explore recordings from SD card. But you can not download.For download in mobile you have to subscribe Imou protect plan, which is expensive.Without Internet it is useless.I think all above points covered to take decision for go with Imou Ranger 2.Overall works as expected.",4.0 out of 5 stars

5194,A friend once told me that Sony makes the best cameras. That statement is very much true in the case of this once. Thinking that this product is not good because it is from the budget lineup would be a huge mistake. The expensive full frame cameras would of course be better than this one. But this one is also good. The worst thing that can happen to a customer is getting a product with manufacturing defect. Other than that there is nothing to dislike. Just one complaint the battery could have packed more juice given it’s size.,5.0 out of 5 stars
5195,Sample unedited images attached.Bought it after going through lot of reviews. Looking for a compact dslr quality camera with good features and mainly 4k video recording w/o any time limit.Was confuses b/w this and Fujifilm. Was really into the fuji retro look and there color effect but bought it due to offers in Amazon great India sale.Bought it just before our Diwali holiday and explored it throughout the trip and believe me no regrets. It has lot of customization related to the buttons and dials. Images come really good.If you can use the settings then many a times there is no need for editing as well.You can save them in raw as well with jpeg.On highest quality the size of on jpeg is around 14-15 mb.I bought it mainly to shoot my videos and the quality is just amazing.View finder is good and it has proximity sensor so screen turns of when you move near to view finder which is really good.There is a recording mode and a dedicated recording button which enables you to record any time. Sound is also clear and w/o any distortion or lag.Another plus is it's wireless connectivity. You can transfer the images and videos wirelessly over wifi through it's app that too in full quality and size. So if you want to share the images or videos instantly then it's a big plus. Then app can act as a remote also to click pics but you can't record videos with app.I hope they will bring that feature in future update.Build quality is superb it feels amazing in hand and is really compact(after using Nikon D5100).One major drawback is the screen tilt functionality. Not sure what sony was thinking while designing it. Even our Nikon D5100 which is like 9 years old as a side flip and rotatable screen which is way more convenient then this one.Second thing is I would really like if they have provided pause functionality while taking videos.Other thing is no seprate charger and small battery.Overall I am quite happy with the quality and performance.,4.0 out of 5 stars

5197,I purchased this product on 7th of July and it was delivered on the very same day. The packaging was really bad by Amazon standards. It was basically just wrapped in a thin see through sheet of plastic. The product as well as the price were all clearly visible through the packaging and since it was raining that day some water had gotten through the plastic covering and on the box of the camera. Maybe I am just spoiled over the years by amazons awesome packaging but still this was a let down for the first time.Apart from that I had an issue with the memory card bundled with the camera. It was corrupted and nothing I did could fix it. So I arranged for a replacement but was informed since this is an expensive product only return is possible. So I opted for a return but then decided to get it checked at the sony service centre. Long story short they fixed the carded immediately. Really happy with Sony's service. I hope I'll get the same response in the future as well. Coming to the product there's nothing much to say. Sony's the best at what they do (Apart from the mobile decision😅) . But I am happy with the purchase and awaiting the rains to stop so I can take this baby out and start clicking.,5.0 out of 5 stars

5199,"Auto Focus is very fast, super fine quality, but you doesnt follow in monitor, you need to follow in viewfinder, because too difficult to find correct brightness in monitor display, so you will find with view finder, battery discharges with in 45 minuites for video recording, so take two separate batterys, don't charge to camera with given sony adapter, please go to third party chargers, just like canon chargers!! image stabilization is too bad, camera doesn't have image stabilization, it is a big cons ,☹️.. only OSS lens can manage image stabilization, if any cons in this camera , i will update after use of this camera,😁",5.0 out of 5 stars
5200,"Best autofocus, better than canon or nikon. Good iso performance. My advice is - if you have a little more money just buy the camera body only - without the kit lens. You will save atleast 10k. And then buy Sigma's apsc lens - 18mm to 50mm, OR the Tamron 17-70mm lens.Both of these pair well with this camera and you will get some amazing shots.If you have budget constraints canon m50 is a good alternative.",5.0 out of 5 stars
5201,"I am not a professional in this field, so whatever I am writing is what I want in a camera and if it is really worth it.This is my first camera, and before it, I was using my one plus 3 to shoot videos for my channel. Definitely there is no comparison between both of them, but during the purchase, I was a bit confused between Canon eos 200 M2 and a6400. To save my money I wanted to go with 200 m2 but the focus tracking system of A6400 is absolutely amazing and being a maker I want my camera to track my hands not the objects lying around onto the workbench and in that case, A6400 never fails. Sometimes I am 3D printing some work and want my camera to follow the printer nozzle and it never disappoints. The slight downfall is that you cant use the touch screen to navigate into the menu page but my menu tab helps you to keep your most-used menus in first priority. So for me its never been a barrier. If you want a camera and object tracking focusing is not your priority then you can go with canon 200 M2, but if it's your first priority like me then sony A6400 never ever going to disappoint you. Overall for me A6400 definitely worth the money spend on it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
5202,Go for alpha 6600 if you don’t want to end up with battery drain so quickly and stablization problem. It is using Np fw 50 battery which half of the fv50 which is used in the a6600. It do not have inbuilt stablization so end with not properly configurable with high end sony lenses. And with out stablization lenses cause too much jitter in the video.,4.0 out of 5 stars

The battery is dying quick than expected need to get extra battery.4. Remote control in mobile doesn't take videos.Conclusion :Great camera overall for vloggers and also for still images, with the amount of lenses available for sony e mount you can create amazing pictures. I bought this camera with body only and lens as Sony 18 to 105mm f4 G lens, better option compared to Kit lens. To get sharp images.

5306,"About 3 months of use now. Excellent image quality. App is ok. But after using both Qubo and regular CCTV +DVR, here is my comparison.The pros- Qubo is not Chinese, so excellent customer support plus cloud recording is stored in India.- it can turn 360 deg unlike most CCTV. Also tilt up and down ( buggy). Good coverage area. Also has an option to track movement. So I use Qubo in certain rooms.- very good image quality. But again lot of CCTV cameras now have pretty good image quality.The cons- all recording is first to the SD card. Even if you have Qubo's paid cloud recording, it will still record to SD card first then to cloud. No SD card means no recording even if you have a cloud storage plan. This is a big problem. They never mentioned this when I bought Qubo. So SD card is a must to record anything. If theif removes SD card, no recording then ! Why Qubo never mentioned this fact while selling ? They should have include an SD card in the box.- Need power back up for camera. Wherever the camera is placed, need plug point nearby. That also means inverter supply to camera plug point. Else if theives cut power supply, again no recording. CCTV has power coming through the communication cable itself. So no extra plug point, inverter back up needed only to the mother unit with DVR this gives backup power supply to all CCTV cameras.-I bought a platinum plan cloud storage (about Rs 1100/yr) so that I can get upto 14 days of recording. But the app did not show the plan for over a month. Had to call up customer care to get things sorted.- after inserting an SD card, the camera lost the full up and down tilt movement. I think the SD card even after fully inserting in, is rubbing inside. I need to call up customer care and will update here.- need WiFi network. But this is really not a big issue as most people have camera located within WiFi zone else you need WiFi extender.Considering the following ...1. annual payments for safe cloud recording,2. continuous power back up needed for all cameras,3. If thief removes SD card then no recording even if you have power back up and cloud storage.Final verdict- unless Qubo offers SD card free recording straight to cloud + rechargeable built in battery, I think going with a made in India CCTV + DVR is the best. Old technology, but you sure know for sure it works.I had originally given 3 stars but customer care is pretty good, I gave it 4 stars.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Unlike some other well-known brands that claim to offer cloud storage but fall short on their promises, the Qubo 360 Cam truly delivers on its cloud feature.What I love most about this camera is its impeccable motion detection capabilities and its ability to accurately identify people. No more false alarms triggered only alert me when it's truly important. I receive alerts promptly whenever the camera detects any activity, and thanks to its accurate person identificationDue to cloud storage, I can access my past footage and video from anywhere, anytime even if the camera is offline or OFF.I recommend the Qubo 360 Cam for indoor CCTV.",4.0 out of 5 stars

5323,"It fulfills its primary role well. The camera is good, clarity is great, person detection is precise, sends alerts to mobile. You can choose between three modes from your mobile app - Home, Away, and Night, and for every mode set preferences for alerts and recording. For 1st month, cloud storage is free and chargeable thereafter, but if you don't want cloud storage, memory card storage is always there. The camera is made in India. The power Adapter is also made in India but by a Chinese company. Two-way communication works well, the mic of the camera picks up surrounding voices and noises well. The ""Siren"" is not loud enough to serve its purpose.Amazon details and packaging box says it works with Google Home (OK Google) as well, but there is no document or YouTube video explaining this. There was no instruction manual inside the box, not even the warranty card as mentioned on the box.A couple of desirable options, which could have made the product wonderful are:A lighter and more responsive Android App - the App is rather heavy and takes time to load and go liveAn option to view the video on a smart TV (with Chromecast/Firestick) and/or Web Browser (thru login). The Web browser option could be extremely useful when working in the office on laptops and need to keep a vigil at home.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Integration with voice assistants adds convenience. Setting up and using the camera is a breeze. For those serious about home security, the Qubo Smart 360 Ultra 2K is a must-have, earning a solid 5-star rating for its impressive features and reliability.",5.0 out of 5 stars

5328,"1. Video and picture quality-day time as well as night time is very good.2. Person detection is okay.3. In Motion detection: at times the cam got stuck to the slight fluttering curtain while my movement was getting ignored.4. Volume of alarm is not loud enough to get attention from neighbourhood. Hence, doesn't seem to be of much utility.5. 2 way speech is pretty bad and useless. It was hardly discernible and hence of no use at all.6. Installation of cam and app was quite easy.7. Power cable is a mobile charging adaptor with about a meter long micro USB cable. It would have been better if the power cable was connectable directly to some power source rather than on a power socket which can be easily switched off.8. Notwithstanding all these I won't mind buying this again as it's economical.9. Further review will be done again as I use the product",3.0 out of 5 stars

5349,The camera gives good 360 coverage and is value for money. Can be controlled easily via the app. The app can be however improved - there is no mass delete options for videos and false negatives of people recognition is high.,4.0 out of 5 stars
5350,An OK product for the price. Does the basic job of recording & keeping you house safe. App is stable & can be used to record you house. The AI tracking & detection feature is useless. It detects any moving object & sends unnecessary alerts. I am bombarded with alerts of moving curtains due to winds & it for some wierd reason detects my lamp shade as a person. The camera trqcking feature is sluggish & gets hanged at a particular position. It is also slow & may not really capture the face of an intruder moving fast.,3.0 out of 5 stars
5351,"The camera is exactly what it says it is. Pan/tilt + 2way audio + night vision + local & cloud storage.The setup is a breeze and works perfectly with 2.4 GHz network, be it your wireless router, or mobile hotspot.Seeing it delivers what it promises perfectly well, I am happy with it. But being a tinkerer, I would have liked to see more storage options like ""DVR"" and ""private cloud (AWS S3)"" added in-built.I would also like to see a IP camera type feature which could show us live feed from the camera over a localised network webpage, instead of only on qubo's App.Obviously, this would push the price up a lot, but at least a model in Qubo's lineup with those features will be very good to have for people who want them.Afaik, there's no other security camera available in India which gives this feature, but there are plenty available in the international market, so Qubo can capture a niche market we'll before others jump on to it.",4.0 out of 5 stars

5353,"The device is small and compact and works as advertised. The live view and person detection feature is good and detects a person if they are standing behind the gate or if any object is in between and sends a notification. The motion detection is something I have not used a lot, it detects motion fairly accurately.Night vision is also good, it is not color but good enough to see the person and movement. The audio quality is also good.You can use SD card for continuous recording and the app shows the amount of memory used on the card instantly. The app interface is also good and it is very easy to setup.The only thing is while installing if you are using any mount, use the smallest mount possible. All ready made mounts are big but this camera is compact so the holes might not line up.Overall, a good deal and it also gives cloud subscription free for first month while setting up.",5.0 out of 5 stars

5366,"I recently purchased the Qubo Smart 360 WiFi CCTV Camera for my home, and I must say it has exceeded my expectations in every way. This impressive security camera, proudly made in India by Hero Group, offers a comprehensive range of features that provide me with peace of mind and a sense of security like never before.First and foremost, the camera's video quality is outstanding. With its 2MP 1080p Full HD resolution, I am able to capture every detail with remarkable clarity. Whether it's monitoring my home interior or keeping an eye on the front porch, the Qubo Smart 360 delivers crystal-clear footage, ensuring I never miss a thing.The Two Way Talk feature is a game-changer. I can communicate with my family members, visitors, or even pets remotely through the mobile app, creating a seamless connection no matter where I am. It's incredibly convenient to be able to reassure my loved ones or give instructions when I'm away from home.The integration with the mobile app is seamless and user-friendly. I can easily access the camera's live feed, adjust settings, and review recorded footage with just a few taps on my smartphone.

5374,"The product is fairly ok-ish. Nothing great like a lot of the reviews on Amazon suggest (will get to that in a minute).The motion detection, the night vision, the installation, etc etc is all good but the camera itself is super buggy. It will get stuck in weird angles and won't move when motion is detection or will be in an angle where no motion can be detected, for e.g, pointing at the ceiling. The device needs to be restarted in which case it reverts back to normal. I can understand it happening once or twice but it happens way too often for it to be just a one-off. Now what is the point of a security camera if it misses events when stuck in weird angles?That said the tech support is super good and they have replaced my Qubo 360 camera as it is still under warranty. I am hoping that the new device is not half as bad as the first one.After I purchased the product the customer service team called me every 2-3 days and told me that if I wrote a ""good"" review on Amazon and sent them a screenshot I would get extra warranty and extra months on the cloud membership. So that may explain the high ranking of this product on Amazon.My 2 cents - tread carefully as what you read on here may not be the truth.

The camera takes in memory card that is Fat32 so please format the card to fat32 before installing the memory card.1. There were many skips in the recording and this left gaps in the timeline.2. The camera was able to detect a person coming up the stairs through motion detection but was unable to detect the same person going down the stairs. Hence it has bad motion detection.3.

It will not be DSLR like, but this is not a professional camera. Its primary use is to quickly capture moments of time which you can cherish forever.Cons:- Manual controls are very cumbersome to use- Camera turns off if you close the screen module- Interface to playback the recorded videos is slow and complex. Better just copy the files to your PC and watch.Other things to note:- Good quality videos (1080p50) take a lot of storage space. Get atleast 64GB card for this.Also make sure you have enough space on your hard drives because they will be filling fast if you shoot regularly.(Though you can save a lot of space by converting the videos to a lower bit rate at the cost of video quality and your CPU's time)- It doesn't have a microphone input.Bonus:Seller 'Appario Retails' was generous enough to provide me a carrying case and an extra battery free of cost.

Asked for a replacement which was sent by Amazon. Again faced the similar experience. This time the camera was looking new but failed to turn ON. The Sony box which contains the camera looked brand new with a proper seal but on closer examination it created doubt about the seal. The seal on the box looked like it wasn't sealed in factory. Not expected from either Sony or Amazon. If you are selling recycled/refurbished products or repacking it outside factory please mention that it is a refurbished product and not a new.

Unfortunately, for the past few weeks, it has not been working flawlessly; sometimes the signal is so weak that it is not possible to view live camera from the Tapo mobile app. I don't know if it's a software issue or a weak wifi signal causing the problem.

5476,"I installed this camera 3 days ago. It is pretty light, easy to setup and has been working well so far. Notifications have very little delay and app works fine as well. I also installed the SDHC card in it today. App allows me to control the recording behavior - whether you want continuous recording or recording only on detections (which significantly optimizes the storage). It also loops so once the memory is full, it will start overwriting the old one.One significant flaw that prevented it from getting 5 star is that they upsell their subscription plan for even the rich notifications. Getting a thumbnail of the event or clip of video in notifications is very critical to quickly review and triage however in order to enable the rich thumbnail, they still want to you to sign up for the monthly or yearly plan. I am ok paying money if I want to use their cloud storage, but thumbnail / video clip could have been fully generated on the device and should have been offered without the forcing function of online storage.My other Google nest camera sends me rich notification without any subscription.",3.0 out of 5 stars

5478,"This review comes after using the Tapo C100 camera for a couple of weeksI use it to monitor a few stray cats that I take care of in my apartment. So the camera is fitted in the basement car park. I have designed a long range WiFi system and I use MotionEyeOS on a raspberry pi as a DVR.The good points:1. Night vision is very good. Very clear images.2. Motion detection is good. You get a notification on the Tapo app when the camera senses movement. If you point this camera on an area which has a lot of movement, you can define zones that you want to monitor for movement.3. Camera offers RTSP and ONIF streams. I use the RTSP stream to connect to my MotioneyeOS on the Raspberry Pi and it works quite well. That is how I am able to get still images.4. The Tapo app is easy to use once you get a hang of it. Playback from memory card is smooth. and the live view is smooth as well (it better be!).5. Speaker and audio is very good for the price point.6. Easy to mount and swivel on the base.7. Angle of view is wide.The not-so-good points:1. Camera only connects to 2.4Ghz WiFi and that to only to channels 1, 6 and 11. Depending on where you live, your WiFi might be weak in these channels.2. Camera seems to go offline if there is no internet connection when it is booting up. This is a problem when there is a power cut and the Internet is not yet available before the camera boots up.3. The alarm cannot be trigged on demand. It will automatically trigger when there is movement, if you have configured it to do so.4. Images appear over sharpened. See example photos I have posted.5. No cloud storage. So the cam needs to be connected to the internet for you to see the images on the card. However, this problem can be mitigated by using a DVR (MotioneyeOS in my case).My conclusion is that for its price, the Tapo C100 is an excellent WiFi IP Camera. Just for comparison, a Raspberry Pi zero costs 1500 and a decent Raspberry pi camera with a wide angle lens and night vision costs twice as much. I have gone that route only to realise that buying a readymade WiFi IP camera is cheaper.",4.0 out of 5 stars

5480,"It stopped (C100 model) working after approximately 2months. It refuses to power on. The charger is ok since it powers on other devices. So it must be a prob with the camera. I called their toll free #. They asked me to troubleshoot by turning it on, pressing the reset button with a pin, asked me to check the extension cord/power outlet. It refuses to turn on. They also asked for the hardware version and serial # printed on the bottom of the camera. Since nothing worked, they then sent me an email with the address of their service center. So will go there and see what happens. Some yrs earlier, I'd purchased a different TPLink product - a usb wifi. That stopped working after some 6-8months. So i did have my doubts. I currently use a DLink usb wifi, which works well several yrs down.Update:I went to their service center which is 10km away (Nagarathpete, near SP Road). They took the camera back and said they'd call me to pick up a replacement in 10-15days. So I will have to go back. But without a cctv, I get tense, cause in my area, plenty of mishief happens. So next time, think I'll go for a different brand.Update 2:I got my cctv back from the service center. It's working ok now. I think what might hav caused it to malfunction is - I wrapped black cardboard around it and made a small hole in the center for the lens. This is so it can function as an external camera from inside my home. Without the cardboard, the infrared bounces off the window pane and all I see is the reflection of the camera at night. So one way to get it to work at night is to use it in ""daylight"" mode so the infrared light doesnt turm on, and it relies on the street light outside my home to see at night. Other option was blocking off the infrared light inside the cam with cardboard - this may hav caused the camera to heat up and malfunction. So I'd advise not to use this cardboard method. Think this is a good cctv, wud recommend it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
5481,"UPDATE: DON'T BUY IT FOR USING AS BABY MONITOR, COMPLETELY UNRELIABLE FOR THAT. Motion sensing notifications only work when there is a gap of 10 minutes between each motion. If the baby moves within few minutes of the previous notification, the app won't detect it, won't send a notification!All this when the screen is continuously ON and watching the live camera feed. As I already wrote below, the TAPO APP IS USELESS for motion detection because it stops sending notifications after 5 minutes of turning off the screen.OLD REVIEW: I bought it specifically for using as a BABY MONITOR. Camera is perfect with lots of adjustments and functions. Motion sensitivity is perfect and adjustable.Night view (infrared) IS TOO GOOD, I can even see a tiny 1 inch toy on the bed in pitch black room!The camera app called ""TAPO"" IS USELESS FOR MOTION DETECTION WHEN MOBILE SCREEN IS TURNED OFF. I have done 100 tweaks in the phone like disabling optimization, enable auto start, battery optimization, lock app in recents tray etc etc. But TAPO app notifications stop after 5-6 minutes of turning off the screen anyways. Obviously it's the fault of App developers because not a single other app gets killed like this like Skype, WhatsApp etc, they run perfectly in the background.So I am forced to keep the phone's screen on continuously to receive timely motion detection notifications. Imagine the battery drain! It's around 10% battery usage per hour with screen on, whereas it will need only 2% battery per hour with screen off!UPDATE: I have found a TRICK to decrease the battery drain while using the TAPO app. I downloaded an app from play store called BLACKR. It turns the mobile screen black (just like a locked screen) without actually turning off the screen. You can make gestures on the black screen to wake it up again. So I run the tapo app then then pull the notification shade down to run Blackr app from the shortcut. Now the tapo app keeps sending notifications for hours while the screen is black, almost like turned off. This way, the battery drain is about 4% per hour which is acceptable.Still I would advice NOT TO BUY TP LINK CAMERA IF YOU NEED IT FOR TIMELY MOTION DETECTION NOTIFICATIONS.",4.0 out of 5 stars

5483,"Update 2: 3rd Oct 2021Cameras have got one or two firmware updates so far. Things have got better quite a bit now.Playback from app has improved.I am satisfied.I have installed the cameras on the walls outside. Away from direct sunlight and rain though. Covered openings with tape to prevent dust and moisture getting in.A year in, so far everything is fine.Update 1: The Tapo app absolutely sucks. Terrible app. Sometimes takes one or two minutes to get video from camera. Viewing recorded video footage is equally painful. You have to play the entire lenght of the video to record. Ridiculous! No option to simply get files from camera. Even trying to change camera settings is lethargic.----I will compare this camera with Mi Camera which I also own.C100 supports ONVIF and RTSP. It makes the camera versatile. You can connect it with software/hardware NVRs. I hooked it up with MotionEyeOS running on a Raspberry Pi.This was the reason why I bought this camera.You can see all RTSP/ONVIF IP cameras in grid view from a computer/Android TV.Mi cameras don't have ONVIF/RTSP support.Mi camera can only be viewed from a phone app. (And chromecast+google displays which most people don't have.)No PC software or even an Android TV app for Mi camera.You can connect it to a NAS where camera automatically uploads original recordings periodically. Tapo cameras don't have this. (You can create a NAS from your PC/RaspberryPi etc.)Tapo C100 over-saturates colors. Too much.Mi camera does it too but not that bad.Field of View of C100 is narrower than Mi camera.When Night Vision (infrared lights) is on in Tapo, three red LEDs can be seen with naked eye. It does not have invisible LED infrared. It makes the camera visible, which is bad.Tapo camera has two hooks on bottom to wall mount. Mi camera doesn't.Google assistant support is there for both cameras. You can cast camera to google home display/Chromecast ultra device.Build quality of Mi camera is better than Tapo C100.If you are only going to use a phone app to view the camera, get the Mi camera.If you need to see cameras on laptop, get Tapo.In case, in future Mi cameras get RTSP/ONVIF support, no doubt get Mi.",4.0 out of 5 stars
5484,"It is a very compact product that can fit almost anywhere. The only drawback is that most of the features that it offers are cloud based and requires you to pay to avail them.Features like ""rich notification"", where the phone notifications also contain a screenshot when the motion is detected, should have been included as part of free service (at least when connected to the same wifi). As of now, the only free notification that you get is an alert with the date and time the motion was detected and you need to open the app and wait for it to load up before knowing what motion had occured.AI motion detection also should have been a locally available free feature instead of relying on cloud. The normal motion detection is not very perfect and has few false positives.Also, a web UI would have been nice to have instead of relying only on the Tapo app to view and configure the settings.Overall, as a normal ip camera with recording, this is great but most features that it provides requires paid cloud connectivity which was disappointing and it lacks a web UI. Hence,I would recommend that you check other brands before deciding to buy this.",3.0 out of 5 stars

5492,"I bought this camera for my parents' home entrance to monitor drunkards littering. I fitted the camera 3 days after it arrived and it worked for exactly 5 days. It wouldn't even boot ON after that. The camera only has a 7 day replacement and the camera failed on the 8th day. The camera has a 1 year warranty so I called the customer care and they asked me to take it to the regional center and these are only in State capitals or major cities and the nearest one for me was 300 kms away. When I told them the issue, they asked me to send the camera by courier. I had to pay 400 Rs for the courier charge, to mail them the camera, so 2400 for camera + 400 for courier all for working 5 days exactly.The first nightmare started when I informed the regional rep that I have mailed the camera but I'm not a happy customer as I have to pay additional for not my fault. He called me and spoke condescendingly that I he hasn't received the camera yet but I'm complaining of delay. I asked him to read the email again as it was about my experience and the additional cost. Then he said once they receive my unit, they will send a replacement. I called the next week again as I didn't hear back and he said it will take 10 days to send the replacement. The 10 days came and went, no product and no update either. I mailed back and I was promised that the item was in transit from the warehouse. I waited 2 more weeks and nothing arrived. I sent a hard worded email copying their management and support including a person called Shawn Qiu. Again, the regional rep responds that they will ship it shortly either that evening or the next day, so they never even shipped my item the previous weeks when they promised it was in transit. Its been more than a month and I have neither received a replacement nor any update. I have since bought a new camera from another brand and moved on. This is just not fair in this day and age. Save yourself the trouble, find a better alternative. I'll consider legal options against this company, if I do not receive the item or a refund by next week. This is not okay.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Its a wifi camera , you can view live and stored recordings (if you have inserted memory card). I'm using sand disk 64GB memory card and it and it stores for 6 days with minimum motion detection.When the storage is full there is option called loop, when you enable it, data gets rewritten automatically.You need to have Power supply and Wifi access always , otherwise you cannot access the camera.Camera clarity is top notch.

Please do not buy this product even if it’s tempting to purchase as less price.Update - tech support did provide support after the review and its been 2 yrs using it without any issues…though from time to time reboots and reconfiguration is required….especially when wifi glitches.

5527,Good indoor camera with night vision and motion detection. Cloud is very very expensive. Storing in local sd card is of no use as anybody can grab it. Use raspberry pi and install motioneyeos and sync a week of data in free google drive 15gb limit. Or use I-Spy to do the same on top of any existing OS and PC. But the pc or raspberry must always on.

It does not show your WiFi listed in the available networks.-> Easy fix, login into your Router interface, change the wireless network frequency channel to 1 or 6 or 11. Reboot the camera device.

Speed of the app. Have connected it through a 4G connection and speed is pretty good when accessed from internet.5. Build quality is good6. Firmware updates.7.

5546,The focusing is best amongst canon cameras I feel. The electric view finder is bright. The image stabilisation works great in combination with Rf us lenses. My hands seem to be more stable because of that now even in low light. The LCD is bright but I am used to shoot through the viewfinder so I use it less often. The contrast seems low in daylight but I guess it’s true for any screen in the sun. Battery life is as expected but good to have two batteries if you are shooting through the day and night on a trip. Works well with the older Ef lenses. No significant delay or autofocus issues. May get the original canon adaptor feels better in hand somehow. The third party adaptor works great too though.,5.0 out of 5 stars

5609,"I didn't know what to expect at first from this cam quality wise but after hooking this up I have to say I am quite impressed, mostly because you wouldn't expect such great range and picture quality from such a tiny lens!! There are a couple of things to consider prior to purchase: One is that where is has to be plugged into an outlet to operate, place it at good clear space with nothing in front of it, so that you may have a good view.This cam is completely undetectable. It looks like and operates like a usb charger. There are no lights on it except for maybe the first minute or 2 that you first plug it in. Also, from what I understand you can plug into an extension cord and maybe that gives a few more options as far as placement but I haven't tried that yetI purchased this to monitor care given to a family member. I found it easy to use and set up. The video quality is adequate for the job. It is very inconspicuous and I don't think anyone would ever suspect that it is a camera. I like that even the SD card slot is hidden so that even if someone were to unplug this, they'd have no idea it was a camera. All in all it is serving the purpose I got it for.",5.0 out of 5 stars

It blinked 3 times and the video started to record.2. I kept camera hole in upward position as shown is second photograph and it recorded videos upside down.But should I complain about it Or simply flip it to record videos correctly??

5673,"This is a great piece of innovation that my famiy and I use for active home security. Works as promosed, records videos on motion detection, software installation on mobile for monitoring works very well with lots of configuration. Simple enough to install and deploy. Adjusting the filters on the app, you get good low light visibility of the camera's vision as well. Support from the team for clarification has been par excellence.",5.0 out of 5 stars

5675,"Seller review- Received the product on 23 aug 2018 delivery is nice and quick.Product review- Product works nicely video quality is good and is 1080p (checked video properties)but the megapixel of camera used is not written anywhere.When i campared it with my mobile, camera quality difference can easily be seen as my mobile has 12 MP camera.But I am satisfied with the video quality of the product.Just 1 problem I think is there that the back cover where we have to insert memory card seems little loose and the two parts can easily be seen seperable through naked eyes which makes the whole spy concept doubtfull.It should be fixed and must comes with inbuilt internal memory also motion detection mode doesn't seem to work properly as it is continously recording although i put it in motion detection mode.If the above point is ignored this charger camera fulfills all its promises and can be of great help for security reasons...",4.0 out of 5 stars
5676,"The seal was torn while receiving.It doesn't have night visionIt has given motion detection and Loop recording option in toggle switch but it only records in 3 minutes of videos in loop. ( no motion detection).Picture quality is as good as that you can identify the person ( not so clear) .Sound quality is good .Range( distance) of covering the view is straight 3 meters wide it doesn't cover view in wide angles that's why need to fix the camera at very specific spot. As per online description it supports 64/128 GB SD card .but the printed description in the box says even 32GB sd card works ( yes it works ) .SD card be formatted into FAT32 by inserting card in camera and connect it to laptop with cable given ( no need of separate card reader ) otg cable may help to watch videos on phone though.As in market SD card is now becoming rare thing to find ,in built memory can be designed.",3.0 out of 5 stars

5685,"Hey Guys please don't say that this product have problem that this and all.. to be honest, I received the product one day before the estimate date. Then Once I got it, i tried to record it and it was not working. So I called their customer service. A lady named Amritha picked up the call and assisted me on call. She was asking about the condition of the product, guided me to insert the SD Card, format it, change the format to fat32, install it back to device, record it, wait for few mins, remove it, plug it in computer, open the folder of video, EACH AND EVERYTHING WAS EXPLAINED IN DETAIL MAN..Which prooves that they are confident on their product.. Also they have their own website and YouTube channel aswell.. u guys can check it...this device is really really genuine and awesome.To tell about the clarity... yes it have a clarity like you watch tv channels in television. But there no night mode. The picture quality is extremely awesome...common guys you have a 1 year warranty, customer support help and a great picture quality...what do you expect more than this...But still if people say that they received the product in damaged condition means, those are fake news guys... Amazon or seller will not send a bbroken product to customer.. treust me guys I know it... so please do not trust if people are telling that the product is fake or broken or any negative things... this is an awesome device... thanks..bye",5.0 out of 5 stars

5688,Product says recordings are 1920*1080 (1080p). But output quality whn played is like VGA. Tooo grainy videoplayblack in respect to 1080p.

5689,"Not bad, picture quality is good, it will better if OTG Cable will be added in this pack to run video through mobile without removing memory card.On the other side, Adopter is too much heated during mobile charging.

5690,"I didn't know what to expect at first from this cam quality wise but after hooking this up I have to say I am quite impressed, mostly because you wouldn't expect such great range and picture quality from such a tiny lens!! There are a couple of things to consider prior to purchase: One is that where is has to be plugged into an outlet to operate, place it at good clear space with nothing in front of it, so that you may have a good view.This cam is completely undetectable. It looks like and operates like a usb charger. There are no lights on it except for maybe the first minute or 2 that you first plug it in. Also, from what I understand you can plug into an extension cord and maybe that gives a few more options as far as placement but I haven't tried that yetI purchased this to monitor care given to a family member. I found it easy to use and set up. The video quality is adequate for the job. It is very inconspicuous and I don't think anyone would ever suspect that it is a camera. I like that even the SD card slot is hidden so that even if someone were to unplug this, they'd have no idea it was a camera. All in all it is serving the purpose I got it for.",5.0 out of 5 stars
5691,"The product works as per specifications provided in the description. Motion sensor is good and picture quality is also good if the surroundings are well lit. No big hopes from night vision. However, just a couple of observations:1. The so called RED light indicator that confirms that it is ready for recording is replaced by BLUE light. It blinked 3 times and the video started to record.2. I kept camera hole in upward position as shown is second photograph and it recorded videos upside down.But should I complain about it Or simply flip it to record videos correctly?? Well flipping it will surely do the trick but the cable blocks the view of the camera while recording as shown in third photograph.Hence, only 2 stars despite being a good product.",2.0 out of 5 stars

5906,"The Samsung M04 offers a budget-friendly option with a 6.2-inch display, providing a decent viewing experience for its price point. Its performance is satisfactory for everyday tasks thanks to the Snapdragon processor and 3GB of RAM, though demanding apps or games might not run as smoothly.The camera setup, featuring a dual-lens rear camera with a 13MP main sensor and a 2MP depth sensor, captures acceptable photos in well-lit conditions, but struggles in low light. The front-facing 5MP camera is suitable for basic selfies and video calls.The device houses a 5,000mAh battery, which can easily last through a day of regular usage. However, charging is done through a micro-USB port, which might be a bit outdated for some users.On the software side, the M04 runs Samsung's One UI on top of Android, providing a user-friendly experience and some customization options. As for storage, the 32GB internal storage can be expanded via microSD card for those who need more space.In summary, the Samsung M04 is a decent budget smartphone that gets the basics done, but it's important to manage expectations given its limitations in terms of performance and camera quality, which are common trade-offs in this price range.",4.0 out of 5 stars
5907,"The Samsung Galaxy M04 is an affordable smartphone that offers decent performance and good battery life . However, it lacks some features such as gyroscope sensitivity and a macro camera 📷.If you are looking for a budget-friendly phone that can handle basic tasks like calling, texting, and browsing the internet, the Samsung Galaxy M04 is a good choice. It has a large 6.5-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 720x1600 pixels . The phone is powered by a MediaTek Helio P35 processor and comes with 4GB of RAM . It runs on Android 12 and is powered by a 5000mAh battery🔋.The phone has a 13-megapixel primary camera on the rear and a 5-megapixel front camera for selfies . It also has a microSD card slot that allows you to expand the storage up to 1TB .🙂",4.0 out of 5 stars
5908,"The Samsung Galaxy M04 in Light Green may be budget-friendly, but it falls disappointingly short when it comes to camera performance. If you're someone who enjoys capturing life's moments with stunning clarity, this phone is bound to leave you feeling frustrated.Camera Performance:The 13MP primary camera on the Galaxy M04 struggles to produce satisfactory results, especially in anything less than optimal lighting conditions. Photos taken indoors or in low-light environments suffer from excessive noise and lack of detail. Even in well-lit settings, the colors appear muted, and the dynamic range is limited. The 5MP front camera is equally lackluster, producing selfies that lack sharpness and clarity. If you're a photography enthusiast, this phone simply won't meet your expectations.Gaming Performance:While the Galaxy M04 manages day-to-day tasks adequately, it's not designed for high-performance gaming. Graphically demanding games often suffer from lag and frame rate drops, making the gaming experience less enjoyable. If you're into heavy mobile gaming, you'd be better off considering a more powerful device.Battery Life:Although the 5,000mAh battery is impressive on paper, the subpar gaming performance drains the battery quickly during extended gaming sessions. While the phone may suffice for parents who use it for occasional tasks, the battery life may not last a full day under heavy usage scenarios.Display:The 6.3-inch HD+ LCD display is mediocre at best. While it gets the job done for casual media consumption, the lack of vibrant colors and average viewing angles fail to impress. The visual experience simply doesn't match up to other smartphones in this price range.Software and Updates:Samsung's One UI skin is generally user-friendly, but the budget nature of this phone means that major updates and feature enhancements might not be promptly delivered. This could lead to missing out on essential improvements and security patches.Conclusion:If you're a photography enthusiast or a heavy mobile gamer, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green will be a major disappointment. The lackluster camera performance, subpar gaming capabilities, and average display make it unsuitable for users who prioritize these aspects. However, if you're a parent or a casual user who primarily needs a phone for basic tasks like calls, messaging, and light browsing, the Galaxy M04 might suffice. For anything more demanding, there are better options available in the market at a similar price point.Pros:Suitable for parents or casual users with basic needsAffordable price pointCons:Subpar camera performance in various lighting conditionsNot suitable for high-performance gamingMediocre display qualityPotential delays in major software updatesRating: 2.5/5",3.0 out of 5 stars

5917,"I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy M04 in the eye-catching Light Green color variant, and I must say I am quite impressed with what this budget-friendly smartphone has to offer. At a price of just 7499, it delivers a compelling combination of features that cater to the needs of everyday users.Performance-wise, the Samsung Galaxy M04 is equipped with a MediaTek Helio P35 Octa-core processor, which handles day-to-day tasks and applications smoothly. The 4GB of RAM ensures multitasking is manageable, but what's interesting is the RAM Plus feature that allows users to utilize up to 8GB of RAM, providing extra headroom for demanding apps and games.With 64GB of onboard storage, there's ample space to store your favorite apps, photos, videos, and more. In case you need additional storage, the phone also supports expandable storage via a microSD card.The highlight of the Samsung Galaxy M04 is undoubtedly its long-lasting 5000mAh battery. For regular users, this battery capacity easily lasts a full day on a single charge, reducing the need to carry a charger around constantly. It's a relief to know that this phone won't leave you stranded with a dead battery when you need it the most.Moving on to the camera capabilities, the Galaxy M04 sports a 13MP dual-camera setup, which captures decent photos in good lighting conditions. While it might not produce the same quality images as high-end flagship devices, it certainly suffices for social media sharing and general photography needs. The camera app offers some useful features like portrait mode and various filters to enhance your photography experience.In terms of design, the Light Green color variant is refreshing and stands out from the usual black or white smartphones in the market. The phone's build quality feels solid, and the ergonomic design makes it comfortable to hold for extended periods.On the software front, the Samsung Galaxy M04 runs on the company's One UI, which is known for its user-friendly interface and customizability. With the latest Android version pre-installed, you can expect a smooth and familiar user experience.However, it's important to note that this phone might not be the best choice for heavy mobile gamers or those seeking cutting-edge performance, as it is more tailored for casual users with everyday needs.In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green edition is an excellent option for anyone looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone. With its striking design, impressive battery life, and the option to expand RAM, it offers great value for money at a price point of 7499. Whether you are a student, a professional, or someone who just needs a dependable device for day-to-day tasks, the Galaxy M04 won't disappoint.",5.0 out of 5 stars

This phone is not for graphic intensive games. But Okay for subway surfer , temple run games kind of games .Issues :I am waiting for UI updates to fix landscape screen crashing. And Also Google play doesn't load up sometimes- need to reset or clear cache .Charging takes 2hrs nearly- I end up charging twice a day.Speaker felt weird for few days- then I got adapted to it.I have mic issues when taking call in speaker mode.Final verdict :If looking for basic phone with 5g processor - UI needs bug fixes though - buy it if you know what you are signing up.",4.0 out of 5 stars
5967,"I like quite a lot about this phone. In terms of hardware, it's an excellent phone at its price. It has 5G, 8 GBs of memory, 256 GB of storage, and pretty decent processor to boot. The hardware specs are neat.So far, I haven't had a good time with the camera. The pictures often come out blurry, which means that autofocus isn't very quick. Redmi's older note phones have better cameras.My biggest disappointment with this phone is the UI. MIUI is a terrible OS if you're into customization and other things. Firstly, don't expect a lot of features that were offered. Xiaomi locks many of the MIUI features for China only, but also locks them out of lower-end devices like this. Secondly, they have disabled full-screen gestures if you're using a custom launcher. The default MIUI launcher is terrible as well and just doesn't look good. For an individual who is accustomed to the stock Android experience, the MIUI 14 has been a dismal experience after almost 20 days of using the phone.I really want to give the phone a higher rating, but the software is preventing me from doing so.

6026,"I got this phone delivered the next day of ordering, as part of prime day sale. Writing this review after few days of use.Well the first impression about the back panel color is - it's blue rather than green! nevertheless it looks cool and feels premium. The glass finish is shiny, but I would recommend to use the rubber back cover that comes with the box. But you might have to invest to buy a transparent, bumper cover in the long run.Display - It is awesome as I keep looking the phone just to admire the different wall papers and text settings, etc. Colors are deep and rich! Almost zero bloatware.Battery - For a mild to medium user like me(about 3 Hrs of active usage), the battery has lasted for more than 24 Hrs. Also the fast charger works as expected. Full charge in less than an hour.Audio - Yes, I do miss the 3.5MM Jack especially as my old phone had that feature. However, the call quality through the device and through the BT earphones are ultra clear. No default music player app provided as in Samsung devices, but YT music/Spotify can fulfill your music needs. Hearing songs through built in speakers was goodIt comes with other bells and whistles like - favorite contacts widget, customizable always-on-display and in-display fingerprint sensor , battery saving mode, etc. I particularly like the fingerprint animation settings.Performance - well for my moderate usage I have not faced any problems so far. Stutter free scrolling, and apps are getting loaded in a jiffy and all the apps work smoothly; notifications work very well. Videos played well. Actually, nothing to complain here in these few days of usage.Camera - Honestly not able to test it in different conditions, but both day and night photos seem to come out well. Video calls quality is also great.Also, the phone does not feel heavy to hold. Even people with small hands should not have a problem in holding and operating the phone.I hope I can write a detailed review after few weeks of thorough usage. Thanks!",4.0 out of 5 stars
6027,"The OnePlus Nord 3 5G has proven to be a noteworthy addition to my tech arsenal, offering a blend of premium features and solid performance. While it impresses on multiple fronts, there are a few areas that could use some refinement.Pros:Sleek and Sturdy Build: The OnePlus Nord 3 5G boasts an elegant and premium design that's a pleasure to hold. Its build quality is top-notch, and it feels like a truly high-end device.Vibrant Display: The display is a standout feature, with vibrant colors and sharp details that enhance the visual experience whether I'm watching videos, scrolling through social media, or gaming.Performance Powerhouse: Equipped with robust hardware, the Nord 3 delivers impressive performance, handling multitasking and demanding apps with ease. Lag and slowdowns are virtually non-existent.All-Day Battery: The battery life has been reliable, easily lasting through my day-to-day tasks and activities without needing frequent charging.Primary Camera Brilliance: The primary camera's performance is exceptional, capturing detailed and vibrant shots in various lighting conditions.

6028,"Since it's my first day. So, I haven't found any difficulty in using it. Just good phone. Since I am using OnePlus from last 4 years this phone is good but it can't be a flagship killer phone overall. Because it's camera and pictures quality are not such good. But it's processor is good which is mediatek dimensity 9000. So, it's performance is good as expected. I have buyed this phones 8GB Ram and 128GB storage version. Yes, it's good but price should be little much low at least 30,000. Or if it's price is 33999 then it's camera quality must be good enough and since after facing all prons and cons it good phone.

Colour science is accurate but it'll make reds more red, blue even bluer etc, that's what you need anyways.Of course night mode stunningly good. I took some samples where a naked eye can't see any details but the device captures without any noise with accurate colour reproduction.

6069,"With 5G connectivity, a 120Hz display and solid performance, the Galaxy M33 5G is Samsung’s best-value smartphone yet under 20K segmentPros Almost half the price of Galaxy A53Exynos 1280 is a solid performerExcellent 120Hz display with smooth experience across the boardHuge performance uplift over M32One UI 4.1 based on android 12 has tons of good features to love, none of the flagship grade features are skipped here (apart from dex mode and spen features), Zero lag or stuttering in 120 hz mode with ease of use and seemless switching of apps without any crash or reloading  of apps, makes using one ui pleasure to surf acrossYou get features like a screen recorder, video call effects, Game Launcher, Link to Windows, Dual Messenger, Quick Share, Music Share, and Secure Folder, along with many others. Some of the fancy Android 12 features, like the ability to change the color palette of icons and menus based on the wallpaper and dim the screen for easier reading in the dark, are also included.Voice focus for calls is excellent feature, phone call quality is really good even in nosiy and crowded areasI had no issues with GPS or connectivity while using Google maps to navigate,  signal stays strong even in rural areas, thats a positive point with good accuracy4g Volte with carrier aggregation works flawlesslyWifi connectivity on the Dual band 5ghz router is strong and performs  more than satisfactorily with low latency responseBluetooth 5.1 connectivity is strong and has good range  no worries of disconnection even as far as 15 metersAudio quality via 3.5 mm jack is excellent compared to Redmi note 10 pro, much more defined and well roundedFor media consumption widewine L1 support is present, Good AV experience on ott platforms, I have no serious complaints about color reproduction in videos considering TFT LCD this panel does a good enough job .Main Camera 50mp is on par and better than Redmi note 10 pro in almost all conditions, retains colors close to reality with good dynamic range and handling of exposure with HDR in photos as well as videos, it is able to handle extremely bright conditions wellEven in shadows during day time it was able to maintain good colorsGood Stable videos at 1080p4k video recording is available at 30 FPS is availableMany cool camera features , boasts AR fun mode, single Take, Object Eraser and Video TNR (Temporal Noise Reduction) which makes it fun to use cameraSelfie camera has good punchy colors, Samsung's way of boosted colour processing some may like it ,some may notExcellent battery life, got 9 hours of SOT despite the heavy usage. It takes around 1.5 hours to go from 0-100, and half an hour of charging can take the battery percentage to around 45% provided you have 25 watt Samsung’s chargerDespite summer time, phone has managed to stay relatively cool, 5nm architecture helping its cause here12 5G BandsDedicated SD card slot is a plus herePD 3.0 25 watt fast charging support reasonable for price segment but we have seen faster charging speeds with other OEMsPromised 2 major android OS updates and 4 years security updates is a huge plus above its competitors, making this device more value for money in long runCons Ultrawide camera is on softer side , lacks details compared to its primary sensor but manages to frame good shots that one can post on social media, macro camera is good with colors and edge detection but lacks depth of field and details , Note 10 pro which is brilliant in this caseNight shots are above average mostly grainy and muddled but better than most smartphones in its segmentLacks some stability in Video recording at 4k Amoled display could have made it unbeatableLacks stereo Speaker, but audio quality on single speaker is quite goodPre-installed bloatwares like Moj, dailyhunt, sharechat, byju's are mild and uninstallable but makes mature one UI experience looks immature out of the boxCurrently device is not tunned for high gaming performance as limited FPS in popular games like BGMI and COD deters it away from being a gamer friendly device, but we  can expect exynos 1280  to resolve over time and be more optimized for more games in future updatesSlightly cheap design , Chunky in size, carries some heft, Dated notch displayLack of charger in the box is a bummer, which adds up to the value cost proposition",5.0 out of 5 stars

6077,"This phone is overpriced for even discounted price (12,999/- for 6 GB variant). I purchased it because of past good experience with Samsung (Galaxy On6) but this phone cannot match the legacy. Samsung has done too much unnecessary cost cutting on this phone.Camera: It has an average camera. It clicks decent photos and records good videos up to 4K 30fps, fhd 60. Only the main 50 MP sensor is usable, all others are present just for count. Camera has serious bug that it captures washed out colours if its AI detects a human face while using flash. If we remove human from frame, it captures just fine colours. Also, colours are just fine while clicking without flash.Front camera is pathetic from today's standard, it will just get you with video calls and nothing more, do not expect to use it for selfies with clarity. I do not click many pictures so I am okay with its camera.You can see this issue in the attached images, both the images were captured in low light with flash, the first one came out fine with colours close to actual object while the second one has completely washed out colours because the AI in phone detected human there. This unnecessary processing ruins the joy and there is no option in camera settings to turn this off. I have spent many hours trying to avoid this with different combinations of camera settings but it cannot be turned off. This bug might be embedded deep in the phone hardware as even third party camera apps ( I tried with OpenCamera) also give the same results.Battery : It can last for around 2 days with light to medium usage. It struggles to last one full day with high usage. Exynos 1280 is not efficient considering it is 5nm chipset. Also, the phone gets warm even with normal usage ( browsing etc) and gets somewhat hot during gaming.Idle battery drain is around 8-10% per night.It charges from 8% to 100% in 4:50 hours with 5 watt charger.With 7.5w (5v 1.5a) charger, it takes around 2:55 hours.Charges in around 2:15 hours with 15 watt charger (shows as fast charging).With 25 watt charger, the phone shows as super fast charging and charges from 5% to 100% in 1:24 hours.Display : Display seems smooth with 120 Hz, obviously not punchy as super amoled but it is okay and has good brightness for sunlight use and sufficiently low brightness for comfortable night use. Viewing angles are good. I did not face any issue with display and am okay with it.Buggy Auto brightness: Samsung has a habit of using cheap virtual sensors on its devices. This phone has virtual light sensors which is just a software solution to set screen brightness according to light present in room and using front camera as the light source. But this is seriously buggy in this phone, the phone does not understand difference between complete dark and dimly lit room. So, it will apply same brightness settings to both of these situations resulting unnecessarily bright screen in dark and uncomfortably dim screen in dimly lighted room. This sensor works poorly in outdoor as well. Most of the time, the brightness it applies to screen is not adequate.Software and UI: Samsung had installed may bloatware apps which are removable, One UI as everyone knows, is pretty user friendly. So, that is okay, however, Samsung should mention that this phone does not support some of the features such as S secure, bixby routines and sound assistant which are useful for some. Otherwise software experience is good, lag free.WiFi: It supports 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz wifi at 1x1. So max of 72 mbps in 2.4 ghz mode and max 433 mbps in 5 ghz mode. This is the most basic wifi configuration possible. It can share wifi over hotspot which is nice. Although basic, wifi will not give any issue and has good range. So, wifi is okay.Bluetooth: I did not test bluetooth range but found it sufficient for my use. It can connect to two different devices simultaneously. However, can play music in one device only. Did not find any issue with bluetooth.Mobile network: It has good 5g support with 12 bands but supports only 1 5g sim at a time. If we set one of the sims to 5g mode, the other one drops to 4g/3g/2g mode.It supports carrier aggregation and when tested, it was working with 3 band carrier aggregation with Jio.Call clarity is good and it can record calls without announcing to other person. virtual proximity sensor is not too bad.Fingerprint reader: For this price, the performance of side mounted fingerprint reader is good enough.We can register up to 3 fingerprints only which is limiting and not appreciated, at least 5 should be given.Face unlock: I guess it has AI based face unlock which works good even in low light condition. Although I do not know how secure it is.Storage and Memory: It has 6 to 8 GB of Lpddr4x RAM which is good for this price.128 GB storage used is UFS 2.1 which is not justified at this price in 2022 and lacks in performance when compared to UFS 2.2, apps take more time to install.Gaming: I installed call of duty mobile and it allowed settings up to medium graphics with very high frame rate and low graphics with max frame rate. In both settings, game was lag free and frame rate was always below 60 fps. So below average gaming. However, I do not play games, so, did not test with other games and do not care about gaming performance.Multimedia: Display quality is okay and single bottom firing speaker is average and audio from headset jack is fine, no complaints here.The chipset used in this phone supports h.264, h.265 video codecs only and does not support VP9 and AV1 codecs which is the most annoying downside. This means that it can play youtube only till 1080p and not in 2k or 4k because youtube supports h.264 up to 1080p only and we need vp9 and av1 support if we want to play higher resolution videos and if in future youtube removes h.264 support then this phone will not be able to play youtube at all. This is a very serious issue with this device. In future, all the streaming services will eventually switch to vp9 and av1 codecs as they provide better streaming efficiency and are royalty free, but as this phone does not support those, we cannot say this will be good for multimedia in future. So, 0 points for this in multimedia.Also, if we play youtube videos in browser like brave, it runs in software acceleration mode ( again, due to lack of vp9 and av1 capability) which loads up cpu and drains battery fast. Use youtube in either Youtube app or Newpipe to prevent unnecessary battery drain (as these apps play videos with hardware acceleration, which saves power). All this nonsense applies to other OTT apps (Hotstar, Prime etc) as well as almost all of them use VP9 codec for streaming which this phone plays in software mode, which shoot up the cpu usage and causes fast battery drain ( around 15-18% per hour).GPS and navigation : Works just fine. Has compass support.Pros:Two promised android updates and 4 years of security updates.Sufficiently good display with high refresh rate, feels really smooth.Good audio, WiFi and Bluetooth.dedicated memory card slot.base variant with 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage which is good.Cons:Samsung cheaping out with no charger/cover/screen protector in box while competitors provide those.5g on single sim only. Competitors provide dual 5g in even cheaper phones.inferior UFS 2.1 storage is not good at this price, UFS 2.2 should be there.only up to 3 fingerprints.Buggy camera algorithm.cheap virtual proximity sensor.buggy camera light sensor.Exynos 1280 chipset claims to be having 5nm lithography which is good on paper, but in reality, its efficiency is on par with some 12-14 nm chipset and it heats under general use. Also, I don't understand why Samsung had to omit useful VP9 and AV1 codec which wouldn't even have costed them more as they are royalty free and Mediatek Dimensity 920 with same Mali G68 GPU supports those codecs. This has resulted the phone to be not able to play 4K and 2K resolutions on youtube.No HDR playback support.",1.0 out of 5 stars

The worst part is the camera , you can't expect a clear picture in this camera ,I was embarrassed of the pictures I took at my office party. I had to ask my colleague to share the picture later which they took. This is my 1st time buying Samsung and was gonna try Samsung galaxy s23 based on this experience.

6084,"Design : great but heavy at 215gm with rugged case 230-240gm, back panel get some fingerprint but not too much. Holding grip is comfortable. It get scratch easily so case is definitely needed.Display: TFT lcd not ips lcd but 120hz is Smooth. Color accuracy is ok, slightly dull in hdr videos, not vibrant like Olde or amoled. Brightness is more than enough in indore but in sunlight it manageable. Yes display is the pain point of this phone.Processor & performance: multitasking is not a problem at all with 8gb ram & umcp 5.1 not ufs 2.2 storage (umcp 5.1 is better than ufs 2.1 in both read & write speed but not matches the ufs 2.2 write speed, so you get the point ). Heavy games like COD mobile, apex legends playable at low graphics with max (60fps) fps. Heating issue starts after 40-50min in winter. Its not too hot to hold, you can play a game.Camera : main camera take decent photo with decent hdr and contrast & enough detail, 50 mp mode take more detailed shot. 5mp wide angle camera at 17499 is painful but ok to have atleast samsung camera software makes the magic to actually produce a usable wide angle photo. Other 2 mp lens forget about that. 8mp Selfie cam take good photo with good details in well lit condition. Night mode on rear is okish but selfi night mode is not ok.Battery: heavy uses at 60hz fixed refresh rate gives 9⅓ hr screen-on time with highest software tweaks & optimization possible. With 120fps it will 6½hr maybe. Light uses easily last for 1 day.0-100% Charging at 15watt it will take 2hr 5-15min . with 25 watt 0-100% it charges 90-95 mins.Software: oneui is oneui where it absolutely shines. With 2 yr android update and 4yr security update. Last android update at dec 2023 and last security patch july 2026. It comes with some bloatware but most of them can be uninstalled. Only 4 samsung bloatware (galaxy store,theme,max,cloud etc )and one Microsoft (one drive) can't be Uninstalled . No ads within oneui software, ads in 3rd party apps is not a fault of samsung.If you want a phone that works no matter it's specifications and security & privacy is important to you then choose samsung over Chinese brand.Smooth flawless user experience.Update21st july 2023Main camera does absolute job no complaints except night time ( not unusable photo but has some grain/ noise in low light condition )I usually charge my phone upto 85% with inbuilt charging protection option given in samsung battery management app and use it until it's 20% then give it to charging and it takes 54 minutes to charge from 20% to 85%While 65% battery gives me at least 6½ hr of screen on time.& another pain point that it has no builtin app locker & network speedometer.On the flip side it has call recorder without announcement and a gimmick (voice focus for voice call clarity enhancement) that works better than advertise.Fingerprint reader is works like 8 or 9 time in 10 attempts. Yes it something it doesn't works on 1st attempt and also when the finger is wet.",3.0 out of 5 stars

6090,"Galaxy M33 5G review, Initially impression looks good feels good but heavy while holding. I am an Iphone user but to get into the Android world i need to backup my Whatsapp data. If you are an Android user then it's easy to back up Whatsapp data in google drive but for Iphone users it's not that easy. Many may be aware that Whatsapp data backup can be done using Samsung devices which run with Android 12. It took nearly 2 hours to complete data transfer from Iphone to M33 device. With datas backup, Now I can switch to an Android device without worrying about data transfering.Unboxing - Box looks slim like a Higher end smartphone, so you can't expect Charger in the box. In Box it has Handset, Sim ejector tool, Type-c to Type-c cable and warranty card.Lets see the Pros and Cons about M33Display:Pros - 120Hz refresh rate with 6.6 inch TFT LCD display and other features like HDR10+ support. It has 1080 x 2408 Resolution which comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 5. Overall it looks like a premium mid range phone.Cons - At this price Amoled display could have been a better one.Body :Pros - Looks like a solid body built with Plastic body at the back.Cons - Toooo heavy to hold with Phone thickness of 9.4mm and weight over 200 grams.OS & Chipset :Pros - It has a chipset of Exynos 1280 5nm processor with Android 12, One UI 4.1 out of the box. Which is good at this price range.Cons - Snapdragon Chipset would be better.Storage :Pros - Internal storage comes with 128GB and 6 & 8 GB variant Ram and also Supports dedicated MicroSD card.Cons - NACamera :Pros - Pro mode available. Nice portrait with 50 MP camera. 5 MP Ultra wide does decent work.Cons - 50 MP camera doest take good pics some places over coloured and over shade in pic and 2 with Micro and depth given for name sake. The 8MP selfie camera doesn't take good selfies but can be used for Video calls.Battery :Pros - 6000Mah battery comes with 25W Fast charging and can be used for a couple of days for day today usage but if you're a heavy user then maybe it lasts for 1 to 1.5 days.Cons - Toooo slow to reach 0 to 100% It takes nearly 2.5 hrs with other fast charges but with Samsung's 25W Fast charges it takes 1.45 Hrs to complete 100%Other Features :It comes with Bluetooth 5.1, Wifi - Dual band, Wifi Direct, GPS, NFC, Reverse charging and Samsung Pay in it.Conclusion :If you ask me, Best Premium mid range smartphone for overall performance but if you need to purchase it as a camera performance then you need to consider other phones with same spec.",4.0 out of 5 stars

6102,"Well i am writing the review after using this phone for nearly 10 days , we my experience is as follow1.OFFER HELP ME BUYINGi purchased this device in Rs 9400 in Amazon summer sale ( including all offers) refer image attached , So for me in this price range i think this is the best what i can get2. WHY M33 5GWell This is my first Samsung device in 10 years of using smartphone & before buying there are lot of negative notion against this device but as amount and offers are tempting so i decided to buy the device , BUT i can say there is lot of noticeable difference between this Samsung device and others from MI , POCCO'S & REAL ME (BEEFORE I HAVE REALME 6) well the difference are as follows2.1. the screen :- Lots of you tubers and electronic gurus told the screen is bad , etc. etc . but as per my usage the screen is awesome not comparable to AMOLED but better than all other group IPS panels , i like the 120 HZ scroll feature is great .2.2. Software:- In my home there are lots of MI, Realme devices and we all have one complaint in common that is bloatware, unwanted messages due to which whole phone experience go to waste coupled with Bugs in UI, So this time after buying Samsung M33 i get rid of lot of bloatware's and unwanted advertisement2.3 Built :- built is simple and solid , i like the Rugged built with Gorilla Glass 5 protection , Over all it is good2.4. Network Connectivity :- Samsung is very old company in telecom as compared to these new Age smart phone manufacturer, and believe me Samsung device are far far better in connectivity as compared to other my all old devices from chinsed manufacturer always struggle with network and connectivity issues but this device is lot better if your prime aim is to communicate and do calls2.5. sound & speaker:- There is feature of clear sound in the phone ,which is good for long time calls & speaker is loud enough for You tube content consumption2.6. Knox security :- It is very good added advantage for secure online payment , as I am deal high on online payment then this feature have very required security for day to day money transfer2.7. Battery & Processor - Processor is snappy and highly responsive and combined with 6000mha battery due to this the device is long lasting hours of usageConclusion :- I am experienced smartphone user and always emphasis that one should buy phone as per his or her prime requirements and I found this Samsung device M33 a well balanced smart phone and will recommend others to buy one because the There is no alternative to network connectivity and Knox security if we compared to other devicesTHANK YOU",4.0 out of 5 stars

6111,"Everything is excellent about this phone except the Face Recognition which doesn't work if light on the face is slightly less .And the Finger Sensor, instead of on the back side of the mobile, is on the side On/Off Key which doesn't work properly since the space on the side Key is too little to recognise the Biometric. Moreover, for the Screen Shots one has to use the low volume key and on/off key simultaneously, which is cumbersome unlike M30 model where just swipe of screen is enough.Other functions seem to be good although it's too early for me to comment, since I bought the phone just 2 days back on 10th June 2023.",4.0 out of 5 stars

6123,"Got fot 17,500 (8gb/128gb)First impressions are quite good and I will update this later if I find anything.Weight - well distributed all over the phone, feels light compared to 5000mAh phones.Plastic - the phone is not in a box design like that of iphones, it is like old phones in hand feel.Camera - below average camera of both front and back, the back cameras quality can be justified in thi price segment but the front camera is horrible as hell, the phone lags in the front camera, can't take decent photos with it. The front camera should at least be usable in this price range. But ok for video calls and etc.On using the 25watt charger the charging is fast, like 1.2 hours from 20 - 80, the speed is good, phone surely gets super hot at 80% charge on 25 watt charger, so I recommend plugging it out or switch on that don't charge over 85% option.Any other questions you can ask me directly at @yadfish on twitter I will answer you.If you are thinking to buy it over Chinese brands, I would recommend it to you, but if you want Amoled, dual speakers then increase the budget and you can go with A34 5g or s21 fe 5g, or in Chinese you can go with Redmi note 12 pro series or Iqoo equivalent series.",3.0 out of 5 stars

6130,"Phone is ok. It has all the features required for a normal user.However, i had faced problem with exchànge. Amazon has come up with a new rule, that order has to be placed from the mobile you have to exchange only. I ordered a phone for my mother, so the phone to be exchanged and the phone from which order is placed are not same. There is a two step verification for this and 2nd step verification didn't go through, due to this difference. Had to pay the exchange money, to take the delivery. They should display this rules while applying for exchange itself.",4.0 out of 5 stars
6131,"1) There is problem with sound. Person on other side mostly says not able to hear my voice. It is not Tower problem as speaking to the same person at same time from other brand phones there is no problem.Whenever I have purchased Samsung the problem of sound is always there.Also it is not a Setting problem of Volume key.In previous 4 button phones the output sound was very low and I had to increase manually each time a ohoe comes. Each time a new phone call comes I have to again increase as it drops back to previous low level.2) This is the first time I purchased a Samsung Smart phone HOPING that it will be better than its next competitor. I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT IT IS NOT SO MUCH USER-FRIENDLY.IN THE SAME MENU YOU CAN NOT NAVIGATE TO DIFFERENT OPERATIONS.3) ONE BIGGEST DISADVANTAGE OF this smart phone ( Must be true for all other Samsung Smart phone models ) is the STORAGE OF CALL RECORDINGS. IN SAMSUNG ALL CALL RECORDINGS ARE GOING TO ONLY ONE FOLDER. SO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT WAS SOME DISCUSSION WITH ONE PARTICULAR PERSON THEN YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE HUGE CALL RECORDING LIST ,GO ON CLICKING EACH CALL AND AGAIN LOCATE THE SAME CONTACT CALL. THIS IS REALLY CUMBERSOME AND GREAT TIME CONSUMING.I had been using the Smart phone of the Competitor so long .I very happily found that all Cal recordings are displayed below the Contact and you can easily locate the call recording and save enormous time spent in Samsung.4) TOOLS- There is NO Tools Folder . The Competitor has Tools Folder which keeps all frequently used Tools in it- Like Calculator, Scanner ,Voice Recorder,COMPASS,Clock ,Downloads etc in one place and you can quickly select that. Here you have to go on searching each.These are the reasons I say Samsungs software is much less user-friendly.I WONT BUY IT IN FUTURE.MY COMMENTS ARE FACT-BASED AND NOT EMOTION BASED OR AFFINITY BASED. AS I EXPERIENCED.5) MOREOVER this 5G is quite costly. The Charger is not being supplied with the mobile. You have to purchase it separately. So with the mobile price you must add the charger price to find out the SET price and compare with competitors' . The Redmi also does not suggest what existing Charger will work ,if some one has that. ALL COMPANIES MUST SUPPLY WITH THE CHARGER AND QUOTE PRICE.I WISH SOMEONE TAKES UP THE MATTER WITH CONSUMER COURT AND THE COURT PASSES ORDER TO ALL MOBILE COMPANIES TO SELL COMPLETE SETS ONLY IN ONE PACKING.",3.0 out of 5 stars

6146,"The Samsung M04 offers a budget-friendly option with a 6.2-inch display, providing a decent viewing experience for its price point. Its performance is satisfactory for everyday tasks thanks to the Snapdragon processor and 3GB of RAM, though demanding apps or games might not run as smoothly.The camera setup, featuring a dual-lens rear camera with a 13MP main sensor and a 2MP depth sensor, captures acceptable photos in well-lit conditions, but struggles in low light. The front-facing 5MP camera is suitable for basic selfies and video calls.The device houses a 5,000mAh battery, which can easily last through a day of regular usage. However, charging is done through a micro-USB port, which might be a bit outdated for some users.On the software side, the M04 runs Samsung's One UI on top of Android, providing a user-friendly experience and some customization options. As for storage, the 32GB internal storage can be expanded via microSD card for those who need more space.In summary, the Samsung M04 is a decent budget smartphone that gets the basics done, but it's important to manage expectations given its limitations in terms of performance and camera quality, which are common trade-offs in this price range.",4.0 out of 5 stars
6147,"The Samsung Galaxy M04 is an affordable smartphone that offers decent performance and good battery life . However, it lacks some features such as gyroscope sensitivity and a macro camera 📷.If you are looking for a budget-friendly phone that can handle basic tasks like calling, texting, and browsing the internet, the Samsung Galaxy M04 is a good choice. It has a large 6.5-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 720x1600 pixels . The phone is powered by a MediaTek Helio P35 processor and comes with 4GB of RAM .

6148,"The Samsung Galaxy M04 in Light Green may be budget-friendly, but it falls disappointingly short when it comes to camera performance. If you're someone who enjoys capturing life's moments with stunning clarity, this phone is bound to leave you feeling frustrated.Camera Performance:The 13MP primary camera on the Galaxy M04 struggles to produce satisfactory results, especially in anything less than optimal lighting conditions. Photos taken indoors or in low-light environments suffer from excessive noise and lack of detail. Even in well-lit settings, the colors appear muted, and the dynamic range is limited. The 5MP front camera is equally lackluster, producing selfies that lack sharpness and clarity. If you're a photography enthusiast, this phone simply won't meet your expectations.Gaming Performance:While the Galaxy M04 manages day-to-day tasks adequately, it's not designed for high-performance gaming. Graphically demanding games often suffer from lag and frame rate drops, making the gaming experience less enjoyable. If you're into heavy mobile gaming, you'd be better off considering a more powerful device.Battery Life:Although the 5,000mAh battery is impressive on paper, the subpar gaming performance drains the battery quickly during extended gaming sessions. While the phone may suffice for parents who use it for occasional tasks, the battery life may not last a full day under heavy usage scenarios.Display:The 6.3-inch HD+ LCD display is mediocre at best. While it gets the job done for casual media consumption, the lack of vibrant colors and average viewing angles fail to impress. The visual experience simply doesn't match up to other smartphones in this price range.Software and Updates:Samsung's One UI skin is generally user-friendly, but the budget nature of this phone means that major updates and feature enhancements might not be promptly delivered. This could lead to missing out on essential improvements and security patches.Conclusion:If you're a photography enthusiast or a heavy mobile gamer, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green will be a major disappointment. The lackluster camera performance, subpar gaming capabilities, and average display make it unsuitable for users who prioritize these aspects. However, if you're a parent or a casual user who primarily needs a phone for basic tasks like calls, messaging, and light browsing, the Galaxy M04 might suffice. For anything more demanding, there are better options available in the market at a similar price point.Pros:Suitable for parents or casual users with basic needsAffordable price pointCons:Subpar camera performance in various lighting conditionsNot suitable for high-performance gamingMediocre display qualityPotential delays in major software updatesRating: 2.5/5",3.0 out of 5 stars

6157,"I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy M04 in the eye-catching Light Green color variant, and I must say I am quite impressed with what this budget-friendly smartphone has to offer. At a price of just 7499, it delivers a compelling combination of features that cater to the needs of everyday users.Performance-wise, the Samsung Galaxy M04 is equipped with a MediaTek Helio P35 Octa-core processor, which handles day-to-day tasks and applications smoothly. The 4GB of RAM ensures multitasking is manageable, but what's interesting is the RAM Plus feature that allows users to utilize up to 8GB of RAM, providing extra headroom for demanding apps and games.With 64GB of onboard storage, there's ample space to store your favorite apps, photos, videos, and more. In case you need additional storage, the phone also supports expandable storage via a microSD card.The highlight of the Samsung Galaxy M04 is undoubtedly its long-lasting 5000mAh battery. For regular users, this battery capacity easily lasts a full day on a single charge, reducing the need to carry a charger around constantly. It's a relief to know that this phone won't leave you stranded with a dead battery when you need it the most.Moving on to the camera capabilities, the Galaxy M04 sports a 13MP dual-camera setup, which captures decent photos in good lighting conditions. While it might not produce the same quality images as high-end flagship devices, it certainly suffices for social media sharing and general photography needs. The camera app offers some useful features like portrait mode and various filters to enhance your photography experience.In terms of design, the Light Green color variant is refreshing and stands out from the usual black or white smartphones in the market. The phone's build quality feels solid, and the ergonomic design makes it comfortable to hold for extended periods.On the software front, the Samsung Galaxy M04 runs on the company's One UI, which is known for its user-friendly interface and customizability. With the latest Android version pre-installed, you can expect a smooth and familiar user experience.However, it's important to note that this phone might not be the best choice for heavy mobile gamers or those seeking cutting-edge performance, as it is more tailored for casual users with everyday needs.In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green edition is an excellent option for anyone looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone. With its striking design, impressive battery life, and the option to expand RAM, it offers great value for money at a price point of 7499. Whether you are a student, a professional, or someone who just needs a dependable device for day-to-day tasks, the Galaxy M04 won't disappoint.",5.0 out of 5 stars

6206," (Update as on 21/09/23)FINAL VERDICT : VERY UNSAFE & UNRELIABLE FOR ELDERLY USERS.Reason:We experienced 3 instances of panic in last 2 months of usage, when I failed to connect with my mom in emergency situations due to this stupid device. I kept calling her, while the phone was ringing (as SILENT) right in her hand/purse but she didn't hear any ring, because the volume had reduced to zero without her knowledge. (Not every time can you feel the vibration as well, and in some cases you may intentionally keep the vibration off to extend battery life.)The stupid volume control button is extremely loose and frequently gets pressed even during normal handling of the device leading to unwanted change in volume levels. On most of such instances the user is unaware about the reduced ringtone volume, and so they don't get any notification if anyone is trying to reach them. This can prove dangerous and even fatal in emergency situations. It's a un-reliable dumb phone!!!Today, I finally decided to dump this phone for a better, safer phone option for my mother (senior citizen).********************Pros:1. Flip Design2. Large KeysCons:1. Extremely Slippery Body.Due to the smooth matte texture of the body and the curvy round edges, the device is extremely slippery with no grip at all.2. They should either make the camera ""camera-worthy"" or remove it entirely. It's useless in this century.3. Reading messages in this phone is very inconvenient. When you open a message, the cursor is positioned in the response field by default and not at the start of the actual message (even for a new message).So, you have to scroll all the way up to the start of the message to read it.I'm wondering, if they were actually thinking that the user will type a response without reading the message!4. To add to this, scrolling is too laggy, SMS font is not easy to read, specially for old age users.5. When you flip open / un-fold the phone, the default landing screen is the list of some frequently used options (see image attached).This same list can also be accessed by the dedicated shortcut key provided on the keypad. I wonder why this screen then, and not the Home Screen??!!6. The volume control button is just so silly. The button is so flimsy that even a slight press on it while gripping/holding/during any movement inside your pocket, the volume may get reduced to level 0. You won't even realise when your phone goes on silent mode unknowingly. And this is not at all safe, specially for old age users.Nokia may have thought that they are making it convenient for the user by making the control so smooth (no tactical feel) but it can also prove a big fail feature.7. They should atleast include 1 set of screen protectors to protect the 2 screens (made of scratch prone plastic TFT). I had to purchase the screen guards separately considering the screens' quality.8. No headphones provided.Specially when this phone's Bluetooth doesn't support bluetooth headphones (considering majority of users use wireless headphones).9. The phone's 3.5 mm jack outlet wasn't very impressive. I tested my wired headphones (SONY XB75) and at some points the connection was breaking with volume fluctuations. I had to rotate the headphones' pin to reach a stable connection.10. In Contacts, there is an option ""Groups"" to group your contacts (under Family, Friends, Work etc.).After saving some relevant contacts, I tried if I could group some of them but I wasn't able to use the feature because when you click on it, you can't go further/add any contact to any group. You may check the quick video (with playback speed x 2).""Groups"" can be a useful feature, and could prove very convenient for quick access, specially for the old age users but the phone doesn't allow it. Not sure why!11. The ""pre-historic"" micro USB based phone charger.I'm surprised why they are still stuck on this port type.In the present era of environmental conscious user base and responsible manufacturing environment, where the world is swiftly and consciously moving towards universal charging options like C-type USB chargers - vintage established brands like Nokia are expected to contribute more actively with more serious intent - TO LIMIT ELECTRONIC WASTE. By still using micro USB chargers for their phones they are only adding to this global pile of e-waste.NOTE: I also found that the charger's port/pin is extremely difficult to pull out once inserted into the phone's charging slot.I wonder if this is some sort of manufacturing defect specific to my device only (will check with the brand support as well).If you are an existing user and experiencing the same issue, can you please share it here?It is a serious issue, as with that kind of forceful pulling, even with both hands you are at risk of damaging either the port or the slot.Moreover, you can imagine, how this could be a big challenge for the old age users - first while putting in that ""micro"" usb pin in the correct orientation and then pulling out that extremely tight port out of the slot.12. Although some users may not prefer this (due to asthetic reasons) but a tiny slot to attach a lanyard chord/wrist strap could come handy, specially when the phone's body is so slippery.",1.0 out of 5 stars

6230,"I bought this phone for my personal use because I wanted that nostalgic sense of a flap phone. But this phone turned out to be so ""DISAPPOINTING"" that you can only understand after using it. You have to use both hands to open the flap while answering the calls hence no Swag. The outside volume button are so annoying, you cannot put this phone on only vibration mode via the volume button you have to open settings to do that( only no ring no vibration can be done). This phone will turn silent(no vibration) in the pocket on its own because the volume button keep pressing in the pocket when you walk(no exaggeration its true). Battery is also not as good as advertised, 1 to 2 days max depending upon usage. It has no WhatsApp, internet is also basic most of the online videos and pictures do not open. Keypad is also not that good its difficult to type. Overall this phone is fit for grandparents use.",3.0 out of 5 stars
6231,"Finally I got my flip phone. Thank you amazon for sending this beautiful piece asap!! I didn't had to pay 9-10k. Still you took almost 1.2k extra than the nokia website's price.Coming to device...Pros:1. No nonsense device2. Get it if you like a flip phone3. For digital detox ❗📵4. Nokia fanboy/girl (90s kid 😉)5. Small device If you don't like to carry glass slab everywhere6. If you like the 'Swag' of slapping the flip on someone's face to show your disagreement.7. Very good sound quality (In this price point)8. Keypad is good.9. Lost lasting batteryCons:1. No KaiOS! Still they could have added few required apps like Spotify lite.2. Nokia 3310 2020 Version had weather app in it. Sadly HMD took it away in 2660. These are very basic app of may be 1mb. This is called utility.Let's forget about photos & videos.Verdict: If digital/smartphone detox is a very important to you & your mental wellbeing, if accessive usage of smartphone is making you vulnerable, if you are willing to live a life beyond glass screens, this is for you! Don't throw your smartphones. These are essential too...but only for utilities. You can watch Netflix on your laptop or computer. TVs have become smart as well.Give a try. Hope you will feel better 🙂Good job HMD. Expecting 'Nokia-like' innovation in feature phones.",4.0 out of 5 stars

6237,"Rating: ★☆☆☆☆ (1 out of 5 stars)I recently made the grave mistake of purchasing a Nokia mobile phone, and I cannot express enough how deeply disappointed I am with this product. From the moment I unwrapped the box, I knew I was in for a world of trouble. It has been a complete disaster from day one.First and foremost, the build quality of this device is atrocious. The cheap plastic feels like it could break at any moment, and the overall design lacks any sense of modernity or innovation. It's like they went back in time to produce a phone from the early 2000s and slapped the Nokia brand on it without any regard for the current mobile market.The performance is laughable, to say the least. The phone struggles to handle even the most basic tasks, freezing and lagging with every tap. It's like using a relic from the past, not a device that's supposedly from the present.The battery life is equally as disappointing. Despite being marketed as having long-lasting power, the Nokia mobile drains faster than a punctured tire. I can barely get through half a day of moderate usage without the dreaded low battery warning. This is unacceptable in a time when most phones can easily last a full day on a single charge.To add insult to injury, the software is a mess. The interface is clunky and unintuitive, with settings buried deep within menus that require a Herculean effort to find. The pre-installed apps are mostly useless bloatware that I can't even remove, eating up precious storage space.Customer support is equally abysmal. When I reached out to Nokia for assistance with my numerous issues, I was met with long wait times, unhelpful representatives, and a lack of any real solutions.All in all, the Nokia mobile is a complete disaster. It fails to deliver on even the most basic smartphone expectations, and it's an embarrassment to the modern mobile industry. Save yourself the headache and invest in a reputable brand that actually cares about producing quality products. Nokia is a name I will never trust again, and I strongly advise others to steer clear of this abysmal excuse for a mobile phone.",1.0 out of 5 stars

This one was perfect for me as a second phone. I carry this on weekends. Decent battery life, last approx a week on a single charge. Call clarity is better than the Android phone I have.There is no WhatsApp on this phone, you can use it only for calls and SMS (browsing internet is painful so don't have any expectations). Buy it only for nostalgia and as a second phone. It is certainly built to last. One star reduced only due to battery life, expected more based on reviews.",4.0 out of 5 stars
6248,"I bought this for my father and no doubt the flip feature is very helpful, however there are some ergonomics issues.- The SoS button provided at the side gets pressed every now and then, creating problem and I didn't find any option to disable it.- The user interface is very very bad, dont know what happened to Nokia, despite having the Symbian OS expertise, they put a crap OS on this phone. Even the UI of an old Huawei CDMA 700 rs phone was way better than this one.",3.0 out of 5 stars
6249,"I fail to understand why some manufacturers don't learn from their past. After Nokia failed badly due to its never adapting attitude, they are still on same path to self destruction. The phone is good when it comes to the dial pad size and being a rarely available flip phone in todays world. But giving such a low specs phone for a price tag of 4500 is a real shame. You add 2K and you can get a decent size and specs Android phone with way better tech than this Nokia phone. It was worth in priced around 2 to 2.5K, not a penny more than that",2.0 out of 5 stars

However, there are a few cons:- No dedicated torchlight button for elder people.-The buttons for increasing the volume are very soft so when u open the flip more often than not u change the volume, so that's a nuisance.In the end, u can use the phone if you are a pro but don't give it to ur elder parents as they may not like it.",3.0 out of 5 stars

6258,My LAVA flip phone broken then I bought this one after researching 3-4 days as Nokia is nowhere now in market. But you can believe Nokia old phone. This phone is really very light weight and w.r.t cost I like everything about it. Lets see how long it goes.,5.0 out of 5 stars
6259,"Phones quality is not so good, it quirks as I hold it in my hand or using it for just some normal stuff (back of it mostly). And I think the keypad feels like it will swell as they use to in older phone but probably not just feels like. And yes it feels and it is a bit big if it would 1 or 1.5 inch small that would be great. And I have issue with the volume buttons on this phone, as I always keep my phone one silent (vibrations only) if you use or hold in hand or pull out of pocket the volume clicks very easily and changes all the settings completely and then have to go to setting to put on vibrate only on call or it will vibrate a bit longer when a notification arrives which to me is bit annoying. And the worst part if a SMS comes and it vibrates and if you open that SMS immidetily during the vibration the vibration won't stop at all. have to forcefully switch off the phone to stop. So BAD.And after spending more than 2 weeks with it I can live with it as I'm at home most of time and can see a kind of detox from ""SmartPhones Ecosystem"".It definitely seems like the phone is for elderly people as it has a sos button on the side which can't be changed to something else.Overall it's okaish phone with 4g connectivity as I have Jio 4G sim, it might change to some other phone after my recharge expires on Jio to convert to some other service provider so that I can buy some other used cool older phones from to use 2G connectivity hoping someone still supports that.",2.0 out of 5 stars

6270,"Volume and lock buttons are very smooth and delicate, getting pressed even while holding it which leads to decrease in ringing volume or mutes. No pouches, cases or back covers available which is another minus. Looks and feel are good, but not usable. Can be used as a home phone or secondary device.

6286,"The Samsung Galaxy M13 is a budget-friendly smartphone that offers a long-lasting battery, a powerful processor, and a versatile camera system. The phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 700 processor, which is paired with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. This combination provides enough power for everyday tasks, as well as some light gaming.The Galaxy M13 has a 6.6-inch LCD display with a resolution of 1080 x 2400 pixels. The display is bright and clear, and it's great for watching videos or playing games. The phone also has a quad-camera system on the back, consisting of a 50MP main sensor, a 5MP ultrawide sensor, a 2MP depth sensor, and a 2MP macro sensor. The camera system takes decent photos in good lighting conditions, but it struggles in low light.The biggest selling point is its battery life. The phone has a massive 6000mAh battery, which easily lasts a full day on a single charge. Even with heavy use, you'll still get a few hours of battery life at the end of the day.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy M13 is a great budget-friendly smartphone.

6336,"The Samsung M04 offers a budget-friendly option with a 6.2-inch display, providing a decent viewing experience for its price point. Its performance is satisfactory for everyday tasks thanks to the Snapdragon processor and 3GB of RAM, though demanding apps or games might not run as smoothly.The camera setup, featuring a dual-lens rear camera with a 13MP main sensor and a 2MP depth sensor, captures acceptable photos in well-lit conditions, but struggles in low light. The front-facing 5MP camera is suitable for basic selfies and video calls.The device houses a 5,000mAh battery, which can easily last through a day of regular usage. However, charging is done through a micro-USB port, which might be a bit outdated for some users.On the software side, the M04 runs Samsung's One UI on top of Android, providing a user-friendly experience and some customization options. As for storage, the 32GB internal storage can be expanded via microSD card for those who need more space.In summary, the Samsung M04 is a decent budget smartphone that gets the basics done, but it's important to manage expectations given its limitations in terms of performance and camera quality, which are common trade-offs in this price range.",4.0 out of 5 stars

6338,"The Samsung Galaxy M04 in Light Green may be budget-friendly, but it falls disappointingly short when it comes to camera performance. If you're someone who enjoys capturing life's moments with stunning clarity, this phone is bound to leave you feeling frustrated.Camera Performance:The 13MP primary camera on the Galaxy M04 struggles to produce satisfactory results, especially in anything less than optimal lighting conditions. Photos taken indoors or in low-light environments suffer from excessive noise and lack of detail. Even in well-lit settings, the colors appear muted, and the dynamic range is limited. The 5MP front camera is equally lackluster, producing selfies that lack sharpness and clarity. If you're a photography enthusiast, this phone simply won't meet your expectations.Gaming Performance:While the Galaxy M04 manages day-to-day tasks adequately, it's not designed for high-performance gaming. Graphically demanding games often suffer from lag and frame rate drops, making the gaming experience less enjoyable. If you're into heavy mobile gaming, you'd be better off considering a more powerful device.Battery Life:Although the 5,000mAh battery is impressive on paper, the subpar gaming performance drains the battery quickly during extended gaming sessions. While the phone may suffice for parents who use it for occasional tasks, the battery life may not last a full day under heavy usage scenarios.Display:The 6.3-inch HD+ LCD display is mediocre at best. While it gets the job done for casual media consumption, the lack of vibrant colors and average viewing angles fail to impress. The visual experience simply doesn't match up to other smartphones in this price range.Software and Updates:Samsung's One UI skin is generally user-friendly, but the budget nature of this phone means that major updates and feature enhancements might not be promptly delivered. This could lead to missing out on essential improvements and security patches.Conclusion:If you're a photography enthusiast or a heavy mobile gamer, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green will be a major disappointment. The lackluster camera performance, subpar gaming capabilities, and average display make it unsuitable for users who prioritize these aspects. However, if you're a parent or a casual user who primarily needs a phone for basic tasks like calls, messaging, and light browsing, the Galaxy M04 might suffice. For anything more demanding, there are better options available in the market at a similar price point.Pros:Suitable for parents or casual users with basic needsAffordable price pointCons:Subpar camera performance in various lighting conditionsNot suitable for high-performance gamingMediocre display qualityPotential delays in major software updatesRating: 2.5/5",3.0 out of 5 stars

6347,"I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy M04 in the eye-catching Light Green color variant, and I must say I am quite impressed with what this budget-friendly smartphone has to offer. At a price of just 7499, it delivers a compelling combination of features that cater to the needs of everyday users.Performance-wise, the Samsung Galaxy M04 is equipped with a MediaTek Helio P35 Octa-core processor, which handles day-to-day tasks and applications smoothly. The 4GB of RAM ensures multitasking is manageable, but what's interesting is the RAM Plus feature that allows users to utilize up to 8GB of RAM, providing extra headroom for demanding apps and games.With 64GB of onboard storage, there's ample space to store your favorite apps, photos, videos, and more. In case you need additional storage, the phone also supports expandable storage via a microSD card.The highlight of the Samsung Galaxy M04 is undoubtedly its long-lasting 5000mAh battery. For regular users, this battery capacity easily lasts a full day on a single charge, reducing the need to carry a charger around constantly. It's a relief to know that this phone won't leave you stranded with a dead battery when you need it the most.Moving on to the camera capabilities, the Galaxy M04 sports a 13MP dual-camera setup, which captures decent photos in good lighting conditions. While it might not produce the same quality images as high-end flagship devices, it certainly suffices for social media sharing and general photography needs. The camera app offers some useful features like portrait mode and various filters to enhance your photography experience.In terms of design, the Light Green color variant is refreshing and stands out from the usual black or white smartphones in the market. The phone's build quality feels solid, and the ergonomic design makes it comfortable to hold for extended periods.On the software front, the Samsung Galaxy M04 runs on the company's One UI, which is known for its user-friendly interface and customizability. With the latest Android version pre-installed, you can expect a smooth and familiar user experience.However, it's important to note that this phone might not be the best choice for heavy mobile gamers or those seeking cutting-edge performance, as it is more tailored for casual users with everyday needs.In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green edition is an excellent option for anyone looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone. With its striking design, impressive battery life, and the option to expand RAM, it offers great value for money at a price point of 7499. Whether you are a student, a professional, or someone who just needs a dependable device for day-to-day tasks, the Galaxy M04 won't disappoint.",5.0 out of 5 stars

6350,"It justified the price, looks and design is good. while the things i didn't like about the mobile is, the touchpad is too sensitive, glass is somewhat curved on the edges and just holding a mobile in hand registers your touch which makes operating it totally irritaing and next to impossible as you keep touching the content on screen.Fixed the issue with mobile case cover which covers mobiles edges, another thing i didn't appreciate is the OS. OneUI is not that much of a cleaver UI as comparatively.I'd suggest an other piece before landing on this one",4.0 out of 5 stars

My old mobile Samsung Galaxy M1 core, couldnt complete IMEI verification by the amazon agent, as it dosent support with all the features provided in the updated amazon app. The verification icon itself is not visible on the Orders sections which made it impossible to do the IMEI check by the Amazon Agent. Amazon has to provide a manual IMEI to the agent for verification or has to provide with a different solution as the old mobiles are listed in the Exchange list in Amazon App. The worst part is that the delivery agent is helpless and asking us to cancel the order as he dosent have a way forward.

And also the advertisement is showing that an 18 Watt charger will be in the box. But when you get the box, it is just a 10 Watt charger. And most of all, the phone doesn't supports Fast charging, because I have a 22 watt fast charger, but it doesn't work with it.Otherwise the phone is good for its money because it has 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of internal storage.

6412,"Firstly, the design of the phone is sleek and modern, with a slim profile that makes it easy to hold and carry around. The 6.5-inch FHD+ display is crystal clear and provides a great viewing experience for watching videos or playing games.The performance of the Redmi 10 Power is exceptional, thanks to the 8GB RAM and the powerful Snapdragon 662 processor. The phone runs smoothly and seamlessly, and I have not experienced any lag or slowdown even when multitasking or running resource-intensive apps.The battery life of the Redmi 10 Power is simply outstanding. With a massive 6000mAh battery, I can easily go through an entire day of heavy usage without needing to recharge. And when I do need to charge the phone, the 18W fast charger included in the box quickly charges the battery back up.The camera on this phone is also impressive, with a 48MP quad-camera setup that captures stunning photos and videos. The AI scene recognition and night mode features are particularly noteworthy, as they allow me to take great photos in low-light conditions.Overall, I would highly recommend the Redmi 10 Power to anyone looking for a powerful, feature-packed smartphone at an affordable price. It is an excellent value for money, and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase",4.0 out of 5 stars

6556," (Update as on 21/09/23)FINAL VERDICT : VERY UNSAFE & UNRELIABLE FOR ELDERLY USERS.Reason:We experienced 3 instances of panic in last 2 months of usage, when I failed to connect with my mom in emergency situations due to this stupid device. I kept calling her, while the phone was ringing (as SILENT) right in her hand/purse but she didn't hear any ring, because the volume had reduced to zero without her knowledge. (Not every time can you feel the vibration as well, and in some cases you may intentionally keep the vibration off to extend battery life.)The stupid volume control button is extremely loose and frequently gets pressed even during normal handling of the device leading to unwanted change in volume levels. On most of such instances the user is unaware about the reduced ringtone volume, and so they don't get any notification if anyone is trying to reach them. This can prove dangerous and even fatal in emergency situations. It's a un-reliable dumb phone!!!Today, I finally decided to dump this phone for a better, safer phone option for my mother (senior citizen).********************Pros:1. Flip Design2. Large KeysCons:1. Extremely Slippery Body.Due to the smooth matte texture of the body and the curvy round edges, the device is extremely slippery with no grip at all.2. They should either make the camera ""camera-worthy"" or remove it entirely. It's useless in this century.3. Reading messages in this phone is very inconvenient. When you open a message, the cursor is positioned in the response field by default and not at the start of the actual message (even for a new message).So, you have to scroll all the way up to the start of the message to read it.I'm wondering, if they were actually thinking that the user will type a response without reading the message!4. To add to this, scrolling is too laggy, SMS font is not easy to read, specially for old age users.5. When you flip open / un-fold the phone, the default landing screen is the list of some frequently used options (see image attached).This same list can also be accessed by the dedicated shortcut key provided on the keypad. I wonder why this screen then, and not the Home Screen??!!6. The volume control button is just so silly. The button is so flimsy that even a slight press on it while gripping/holding/during any movement inside your pocket, the volume may get reduced to level 0. You won't even realise when your phone goes on silent mode unknowingly. And this is not at all safe, specially for old age users.Nokia may have thought that they are making it convenient for the user by making the control so smooth (no tactical feel) but it can also prove a big fail feature.7. They should atleast include 1 set of screen protectors to protect the 2 screens (made of scratch prone plastic TFT). I had to purchase the screen guards separately considering the screens' quality.8. No headphones provided.Specially when this phone's Bluetooth doesn't support bluetooth headphones (considering majority of users use wireless headphones).9. The phone's 3.5 mm jack outlet wasn't very impressive. I tested my wired headphones (SONY XB75) and at some points the connection was breaking with volume fluctuations. I had to rotate the headphones' pin to reach a stable connection.10. In Contacts, there is an option ""Groups"" to group your contacts (under Family, Friends, Work etc.).After saving some relevant contacts, I tried if I could group some of them but I wasn't able to use the feature because when you click on it, you can't go further/add any contact to any group. You may check the quick video (with playback speed x 2).""Groups"" can be a useful feature, and could prove very convenient for quick access, specially for the old age users but the phone doesn't allow it. Not sure why!11. The ""pre-historic"" micro USB based phone charger.I'm surprised why they are still stuck on this port type.In the present era of environmental conscious user base and responsible manufacturing environment, where the world is swiftly and consciously moving towards universal charging options like C-type USB chargers - vintage established brands like Nokia are expected to contribute more actively with more serious intent - TO LIMIT ELECTRONIC WASTE. By still using micro USB chargers for their phones they are only adding to this global pile of e-waste.NOTE: I also found that the charger's port/pin is extremely difficult to pull out once inserted into the phone's charging slot.I wonder if this is some sort of manufacturing defect specific to my device only (will check with the brand support as well).If you are an existing user and experiencing the same issue, can you please share it here?It is a serious issue, as with that kind of forceful pulling, even with both hands you are at risk of damaging either the port or the slot.Moreover, you can imagine, how this could be a big challenge for the old age users - first while putting in that ""micro"" usb pin in the correct orientation and then pulling out that extremely tight port out of the slot.12. Although some users may not prefer this (due to asthetic reasons) but a tiny slot to attach a lanyard chord/wrist strap could come handy, specially when the phone's body is so slippery.",1.0 out of 5 stars

6580,"I bought this phone for my personal use because I wanted that nostalgic sense of a flap phone. But this phone turned out to be so ""DISAPPOINTING"" that you can only understand after using it. You have to use both hands to open the flap while answering the calls hence no Swag. The outside volume button are so annoying, you cannot put this phone on only vibration mode via the volume button you have to open settings to do that( only no ring no vibration can be done). This phone will turn silent(no vibration) in the pocket on its own because the volume button keep pressing in the pocket when you walk(no exaggeration its true). Battery is also not as good as advertised, 1 to 2 days max depending upon usage. It has no WhatsApp, internet is also basic most of the online videos and pictures do not open. Keypad is also not that good its difficult to type. Overall this phone is fit for grandparents use.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Nokia fanboy/girl (90s kid 😉)5. Small device If you don't like to carry glass slab everywhere6. If you like the 'Swag' of slapping the flip on someone's face to show your disagreement.7. Very good sound quality (In this price point)8. Keypad is good.9. Lost lasting batteryCons:1. No KaiOS! Still they could have added few required apps like Spotify lite.2. Nokia 3310 2020 Version had weather app in it. Sadly HMD took it away in 2660. These are very basic app of may be 1mb. This is called utility.Let's forget about photos & videos.Verdict: If digital/smartphone detox is a very important to you & your mental wellbeing, if accessive usage of smartphone is making you vulnerable, if you are willing to live a life beyond glass screens, this is for you! Don't throw your smartphones. These are essential too...but only for utilities. You can watch Netflix on your laptop or computer. TVs have become smart as well.Give a try. Hope you will feel better 🙂Good job HMD. Expecting 'Nokia-like' innovation in feature phones.",4.0 out of 5 stars

6587,"Rating: ★☆☆☆☆ (1 out of 5 stars)I recently made the grave mistake of purchasing a Nokia mobile phone, and I cannot express enough how deeply disappointed I am with this product. From the moment I unwrapped the box, I knew I was in for a world of trouble. It has been a complete disaster from day one.First and foremost, the build quality of this device is atrocious. The cheap plastic feels like it could break at any moment, and the overall design lacks any sense of modernity or innovation. It's like they went back in time to produce a phone from the early 2000s and slapped the Nokia brand on it without any regard for the current mobile market.The performance is laughable, to say the least. The phone struggles to handle even the most basic tasks, freezing and lagging with every tap. It's like using a relic from the past, not a device that's supposedly from the present.The battery life is equally as disappointing. Despite being marketed as having long-lasting power, the Nokia mobile drains faster than a punctured tire. I can barely get through half a day of moderate usage without the dreaded low battery warning. This is unacceptable in a time when most phones can easily last a full day on a single charge.To add insult to injury, the software is a mess. The interface is clunky and unintuitive, with settings buried deep within menus that require a Herculean effort to find. The pre-installed apps are mostly useless bloatware that I can't even remove, eating up precious storage space.Customer support is equally abysmal. When I reached out to Nokia for assistance with my numerous issues, I was met with long wait times, unhelpful representatives, and a lack of any real solutions.All in all, the Nokia mobile is a complete disaster. It fails to deliver on even the most basic smartphone expectations, and it's an embarrassment to the modern mobile industry. Save yourself the headache and invest in a reputable brand that actually cares about producing quality products. Nokia is a name I will never trust again, and I strongly advise others to steer clear of this abysmal excuse for a mobile phone.",1.0 out of 5 stars

6609,"Phones quality is not so good, it quirks as I hold it in my hand or using it for just some normal stuff (back of it mostly). And I think the keypad feels like it will swell as they use to in older phone but probably not just feels like. And yes it feels and it is a bit big if it would 1 or 1.5 inch small that would be great. And I have issue with the volume buttons on this phone, as I always keep my phone one silent (vibrations only) if you use or hold in hand or pull out of pocket the volume clicks very easily and changes all the settings completely and then have to go to setting to put on vibrate only on call or it will vibrate a bit longer when a notification arrives which to me is bit annoying. And the worst part if a SMS comes and it vibrates and if you open that SMS immidetily during the vibration the vibration won't stop at all. have to forcefully switch off the phone to stop. So BAD.And after spending more than 2 weeks with it I can live with it as I'm at home most of time and can see a kind of detox from ""SmartPhones Ecosystem"".It definitely seems like the phone is for elderly people as it has a sos button on the side which can't be changed to something else.Overall it's okaish phone with 4g connectivity as I have Jio 4G sim, it might change to some other phone after my recharge expires on Jio to convert to some other service provider so that I can buy some other used cool older phones from to use 2G connectivity hoping someone still supports that.",2.0 out of 5 stars

6626,"I got this phone delivered the next day of ordering, as part of prime day sale. Writing this review after few days of use.Well the first impression about the back panel color is - it's blue rather than green! nevertheless it looks cool and feels premium. The glass finish is shiny, but I would recommend to use the rubber back cover that comes with the box. But you might have to invest to buy a transparent, bumper cover in the long run.Display - It is awesome as I keep looking the phone just to admire the different wall papers and text settings, etc. Colors are deep and rich! Almost zero bloatware.Battery - For a mild to medium user like me(about 3 Hrs of active usage), the battery has lasted for more than 24 Hrs. Also the fast charger works as expected. Full charge in less than an hour.Audio - Yes, I do miss the 3.5MM Jack especially as my old phone had that feature. However, the call quality through the device and through the BT earphones are ultra clear. No default music player app provided as in Samsung devices, but YT music/Spotify can fulfill your music needs. Hearing songs through built in speakers was goodIt comes with other bells and whistles like - favorite contacts widget, customizable always-on-display and in-display fingerprint sensor , battery saving mode, etc. I particularly like the fingerprint animation settings.Performance - well for my moderate usage I have not faced any problems so far. Stutter free scrolling, and apps are getting loaded in a jiffy and all the apps work smoothly; notifications work very well. Videos played well. Actually, nothing to complain here in these few days of usage.Camera - Honestly not able to test it in different conditions, but both day and night photos seem to come out well. Video calls quality is also great.Also, the phone does not feel heavy to hold.

While it impresses on multiple fronts, there are a few areas that could use some refinement.Pros:Sleek and Sturdy Build: The OnePlus Nord 3 5G boasts an elegant and premium design that's a pleasure to hold. Its build quality is top-notch, and it feels like a truly high-end device.Vibrant Display: The display is a standout feature, with vibrant colors and sharp details that enhance the visual experience whether I'm watching videos, scrolling through social media, or gaming.Performance Powerhouse: Equipped with robust hardware, the Nord 3 delivers impressive performance, handling multitasking and demanding apps with ease. Lag and slowdowns are virtually non-existent.All-Day Battery: The battery life has been reliable, easily lasting through my day-to-day tasks and activities without needing frequent charging.Primary Camera Brilliance: The primary camera's performance is exceptional, capturing detailed and vibrant shots in various lighting conditions. It's a joy to use for photography enthusiasts.Clean and User-Friendly Software: OnePlus' OxygenOS continues to be a winner, offering a clean and intuitive user experience that enhances the overall usability of the device.Cons:Ultra-Wide Camera Performance: While the primary camera shines, the performance of the ultra-wide camera falls slightly short. It could benefit from improvements in capturing detail and maintaining color accuracy.IP Rating: In comparison to some competitors, the absence of a higher IP rating for water and dust resistance feels like a missed opportunity.Final Verdict:The OnePlus Nord 3 5G impresses with its premium design, powerful performance, and excellent primary camera. It's a true contender in the mid-range segment. However, a few drawbacks, such as the ultra-wide camera's performance and the lack of a higher IP rating, prevent it from achieving a perfect score.

6628,"Since it's my first day. So, I haven't found any difficulty in using it. Just good phone. Since I am using OnePlus from last 4 years this phone is good but it can't be a flagship killer phone overall. Because it's camera and pictures quality are not such good. But it's processor is good which is mediatek dimensity 9000. So, it's performance is good as expected. I have buyed this phones 8GB Ram and 128GB storage version. Yes, it's good but price should be little much low at least 30,000. Or if it's price is 33999 then it's camera quality must be good enough and since after facing all prons and cons it good phone.

6641,"One good problem OnePlus has is that people expect the company to blow their minds.It doesn't happen any longer.I was recommended Iqoo Neo 7 pro for same price but went with this.Although Iqoo would have better performance, battery etc but you can't discount the CLASS OnePlus has.Camera has a boosted and social media friendly camera. Colour science is accurate but it'll make reds more red, blue even bluer etc, that's what you need anyways.Of course night mode stunningly good. I took some samples where a naked eye can't see any details but the device captures without any noise with accurate colour reproduction. Battery will last easy peasy for a day.Probably mobile isn't for heavy gamer nibbas who play all dayOverall, you'll be satisfied and will be able to use the device for few years",4.0 out of 5 stars

Otherwise battery will last about a complete day with normal usage.

6646,Overall good for normal day to day usage but lag at games a no. of times . It also heat in gaming sessions. Charge completely in approx 40 minutes. Overall camera is good when see the shot normally but lacks of details when zoom in.

But I haven't tested while playing games. Normal usage no heating may be due to the weather in Hyderabad very chilled now 20 degrres only.Mobile is very fast while opening applications and other activities.No lags till now in 14 days.This is my 3rd review and I will date second review after 30 days of my usage.Still need to stabilize screen brightness in some applicationsScreen refresh rate is good and to be updated for some applicationsDay to day usage no issues at all.Charging complete in just 30 to 35 minutes.Complete full day battery life guaranteed for normal usage including insta, facebook and X Twitter usage.Without cover mobile looks very good , handy and light weightNotifications are good on screen example when u place order in zomato, swiggy it shows on screen arrival notification continuously..

Large battery: 5000 mah battery is really useful, my mother doesn't use the phone too much so it's last for 2 to 3 days with minimal usage.3. Android go : it has the Android 13 go edition so it's light version that's why it's working smooth.4. Dual rear camera does it's job but the front camera is really impressive.5.Dialer: It has Xiaomi dialer so you can record call without announcement.Cons :1. No type C port so we have to carry an extra cable as all of our phone has type C port.2. Long Charging time: no fast charging provided so it's taking longer time to charge the battery.3. No widget options ( till now August 2023) so you can't add weather or clock or contact widget on the home screen.4. No double tap to screen on/off feature ( till now Aug 2023).5. It's taking time to load videos or the settings options on 2gb variant, i mean if i open YouTube it's taking 4 to 5 second to load the videos on YouTube ( I'm using the device on WiFi so no network issue, it's happening for the weak processor). I have installed WhatsApp from play store, nothing else installed on the phone but still it's taking some times for some app loading. But it's okay it's not a issue for someone who just started using smartphone.Also you can uninstall or disable maximum of preloaded apps. I have uninstalled maximum of those apps. Also I have disabled the Chrome browser, as my mother didn't search any thing on internet. I have disabled the browser so even if my mother clicked on any link on YouTube or on another apps it doesn't work so kind of safe for my mother also.So i just want to say this phone is just for calling, WhatsApp, for normal YouTube videos & music. Also i think if you are getting the 2GB variant under 6k then it's a good deal. Don't pay more for this even if you are buying 4gb 64gb it will not change much on the performance.Thank you.Edit 1 : Even after getting 3 software updates they didn't include the widgets option as well as the double tap function. So i think this option will not available in future also, may be this features are not for Android go editions. So keep that in mind, although my mother never complaint about the clok as she check the time from the notification bar or from the lock screen.",4.0 out of 5 stars

6733,"After using it for a month, I can state , the Redmi A2 (Classic Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) is an excellent budget smartphone that delivers impressive features and performance. From its vibrant display to its capable cameras and long-lasting battery, it offers a well-rounded experience for the price. If you are looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone, I highly recommend considering the Redmi A2.Pros:1. Great value for money: The Redmi A2 offers an impressive range of features and performance at an affordable price point.2. Vibrant display: The 6.52-inch IPS LCD screen delivers sharp and clear visuals, making it enjoyable for multimedia consumption.3. Smooth performance: The Mediatek Helio G36 chipset, coupled with the octa-core processor and 4GB RAM, ensures smooth multitasking and lag-free performance.4. Expandable storage: The device comes with 64GB of internal storage, which can be further expanded using the dedicated microSDXC card slot, providing ample space for your files and apps.5. Decent camera performance: The dual rear cameras capture satisfactory photos with good detail and color accuracy, and the addition of features like dual-LED flash and HDR enhances the camera's capabilities.6. Long-lasting battery: The 5000mAh non-removable battery offers excellent battery life, allowing for a full day of usage without worrying about running out of power.7. User-friendly interface: The Redmi A2 runs on Android 13 (Go edition) with MIUI, providing a user-friendly interface and a range of customization options.8. Sleek design: The device boasts a sleek and slim design, with the Classic Black color variant adding an elegant touch.9. Added benefit is warranty - 2 years [1 year + extra 1 year (special introductory offer)]Cons:1. Moderate display resolution: While the display is vibrant, the 720 x 1600 pixel resolution may not offer the highest level of sharpness compared to higher-end devices.2. Modest camera setup: The camera setup on the Redmi A2 is modest, which may not satisfy users who require advanced camera capabilities.3. Limited charging speed: The device supports 10W wired charging, which is not as fast as some other smartphones in the market.Please be aware that these benefits and drawbacks are based on individual usage and may change based on preferences and usage patterns.",4.0 out of 5 stars

6735,Met the expectations,4.0 out of 5 stars
6736,"Before saying anything about A2, I would like to mention properly that is a below ₹7,000 smartphone. In this slab of pricing, Xiaomi has packed a USB charger, decent battery which goes on from 13-15 hours in good use (non gaming, movie etc) in single charge.Camera is good, not exceptional.The OS feels like Stock Android. As Classic MIUI Apps seemed missing by me like notes, compass, IR Remote.Does not support 5GHz Wifi. Works smooth on 2.4Ghz Wifi.The built qualify is simply AWESOME. Feel in hand is Awesome.Brithness is pretty good, touch and response time is very smooth and fast. Bootup time is pretty fast too.Comes with a dedicated SD Card slot along with dual sim slots (total 3 slots in tray).In box they have packed the phone, charger, USB type A-B cable. (No tempered glass or back cover), No fingerprint or face unlock - REMEMBER THE PRICE.Final conclusion: the phone is good in this price range specially the smoothness, built quality, screen size, clean Android OS with majority Google's Apps like Google One, Google Gallery etc. Yes some small small things are missing but that is fine because the price is also kept pretty low. The Phone is good for those who have average use of smartphones or if you want to make this as a secondary business need smartphone. Or simply a phone for a school student.I recommend this product untill and unless Redmi asks you to pay more than ₹7500.",4.0 out of 5 stars

6811,"I recently purchased the Realme Narzo 50i Prime in Dark Blue with 4GB RAM and 64GB Storage. While it has its strengths, it also falls short in some key areas.Pros:1. **Affordable Price**: The Realme Narzo 50i Prime is a budget-friendly phone, making it accessible for those looking for an affordable smartphone.2. **Decent Battery Life**: The 5000 mAh battery is one of the phone's standout features. It provides a good amount of juice to last through a day of moderate use.3. **Smooth Performance**: The octa-core processor handles everyday tasks and apps reasonably well, ensuring smooth operation for the most part.Cons:1. **Display Quality**: The display leaves much to be desired. Colors appear washed out, and the resolution is not sharp. It's a significant drawback, especially for media consumption.2. **Camera Performance**: The camera setup on this phone is rather basic. While it can capture decent photos in well-lit conditions, low-light photography is disappointing, and there's a noticeable lack of detail in images.3. **Limited RAM**: With only 4GB of RAM, the phone struggles with multitasking, and apps tend to reload frequently. This can be frustrating for users who like to switch between apps quickly.4. **Bloatware**: The Realme Narzo 50i Prime comes with a fair amount of pre-installed bloatware, which can be annoying. You'll need to spend some time uninstalling or disabling unnecessary apps.5. **Build Quality**: The phone feels a bit plasticky and not as sturdy as some of its competitors in the same price range.Overall, the Realme Narzo 50i Prime is an okay budget phone. If you're on a tight budget and prioritize battery life and basic functionality over display quality and camera performance, it might be worth considering. However, if you can stretch your budget a bit, there are better options available in the market that offer a more well-rounded smartphone experience.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Not good, but so so It is handy phone with 4+64 as well as there is Memory Card Tray also. Some of pre-installed games as well as snapchat, mojo, etc. were there, which needs time to uninstall. No Screen Guard / Tampered Glass on the phone screen. No Plascic Back Cover is there also, which really needed. The company can add hardware also for 'Fingerprint Sensor', this is the disadvantage of the phone, as the fingerpriint sensor is much more secured than the pass lock or face lock. Another thing you can't change the icon shaping, By default it is round, which I hate round shape icons on phone. I'm using Oneplus Nord 2T also, which has the features in software. Not comparing this Narzo with One plus, but they could provide this. Camera quality is so so. Now-a-days normal phone dialer is getting replaced by Google dialer, which has the call recording option, but in this case both of the parties can hear that their calls are getting recorded. They could bypass like Samsung, as Samsung has their own dialer with call recording facility.After one day of using it returned it to Amazon. Charging speed is very slow and incoming calls from any person is not clear. When I call back then it's ok. Not happy",4.0 out of 5 stars

6891,"This review is based on just one day of usage.Likes1.The hardware- the hardware is topnotch for the price. The chipset is fairly decent, cameras are good (not great, but usable images), speakers are above average. Screen is also perfectly usable. Full hd screen with 90 hz refresh rate. Fingerprint sensor is accurate and quick. No heating issues as of now (I haven't used the phone extensively; see other reviews for heating).2. Charging- it is the best feature of this product. The charging is truly best in class. Half filled the phone from zero in just under 30 minutes.3. Battery- again very good. The chipset being sub-flagship is very conservative in battery consumption. As a result, phone easily last more than a day. I charged it yesterday at noon and I still have around 30% left at 7 pm today.Mediocre1. Camera- not best in class. The back camera is decent under good lighting. But quickly looses it when the light fades. Night photography is not good. Selfie camera too is not very good, but still give usable photos in good lighting. Again, I bought this phone for my mom, photography is not her strong point! So, it's perfectly fine for her as it gets the job done most of the times.2. Features- the system has good features such as overnight charging, minimised screen, gesture shortcuts etc. But the overall experience of the UI is ruined by ads, which is the number one problem I have with this phone.Dislikes1. Ads ads ads. Everywhere you look, there are ads. There are ads in the app launcher, there are ads each time you install an app, there are ads when you clear cache using the native cleaner app. There are apps installed on its own without even giving permission. I spend so much time removing all the unnecessary apps and after sometime, some of them came back. The realme app store is the culprit, I believe. Because, after disabling the store, the installing of apps on their own had stopped. This is really a nuisance and realme should never make it so hard for us to remove unwanted apps. Giving ads is one thing, but this is outright attacking people with ads, which is not at all a pleasant experience. There are some app groups called hot games and hot apps which are stupid and came back even after I disabled them twice. Eventually I was able to remove them for good. Only one tip for you- disable and remove network access for the realme app store and you can hopefully uninstall unwanted apps. There were no native keyboard applications (like Xiaomi), thankfully.Verdict- a good option for people with limited budget and needs. There is nothing amazing (except for battery life), but the phone is perfectly usable and fast enough to not being called a slow phone. The UI has good features but infected with ads. I believe premium offerings of realme don't have this problem. Not for people who love ad-free stock Android experience. But gets the job done with little money. Better than the lower budjet (6k-8k) phones. I will give 3.7 out of 5.",4.0 out of 5 stars
6892,"TOP GOOD THINGS I LIKE1) Phone is designed well for this price segment. Even though it is plastic we feel little premium.2) User interface is also much better. I love the way icons are designed. A good job done by realme UI 4.03) Some special features like dual audio, mini caplsule, sleep capsule add uniqueness to this phone.TOP BAD THINGS I HATE:1) Most review said Camera is average but for me I am putting camera performance in below average position. Especially front camera is not worth for this price segment too.2) Display is average. Previously also I used same IPS LCD display but while comparing, this display is poor.3) Performace is little slower. Even I don't have large size apps like gaming apps. Using basic apps itself slower in this phone.BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD:1) Price - I am not sure about this price is okay or not for this phone. But somewhat I feel okay.2) Speaker - Many phone under this price give dual speaker now-a-days but here it is provided with single speaker at the bottom. It's okay really sounds good. But my problem is the special feature ""200% volume"" is total waste. You can hear only noise not a quality sound. It is purely a gimmick.3) Battery - As I told already, I just have basic app not a single games app. Battery is average. But recharge fastly.CONCLUSION:1) If you are new to smart phone. This phone is okay for you.2) If you expecting a best phone in this price segment. Please refer some other phones, compare and decide. If you need good camera phone don't buy this. If you need good display phone compare other phone in this price segment.3) If you need a good realme UI experience in this price segment just order and get yours.",3.0 out of 5 stars
6893,"I recently got my hands on the Realme N55, and while it has some notable features, it's not without its downsides.**Pros:**1. **Decent Performance:** The phone's performance is okay for everyday tasks and light gaming. It handles most apps without much trouble, but don't expect it to be a powerhouse for heavy tasks.2. **Good Display:** The display is bright and colorful, making it enjoyable for watching videos and browsing content.3. **Camera Quality:** The camera does a decent job in well-lit conditions, capturing reasonably detailed photos. The AI enhancements can be hit or miss, but it's fine for casual photography.4. **Battery Life:** The battery life is satisfactory, getting me through a full day with moderate use.**Cons:**1. **Build Quality:** While the design looks premium, the build quality is not up to par. The plastic back feels a bit cheap and is prone to scratches.2. **Performance under Load:** The phone struggles with demanding tasks and heavy multitasking. It tends to slow down and lag, which can be frustrating.3. **Low-light Camera:** The camera performance takes a hit in low-light conditions. The images lack detail and can be quite grainy.4. **Bloatware:** The device comes preloaded with a fair amount of bloatware, which can't be easily removed. It's annoying to have apps you don't need taking up space and resources.5. **Software Updates:** The software updates are inconsistent, and sometimes it takes a while to receive the latest Android version or security patches.**Conclusion:**The Realme N55 is an affordable option with some good aspects, but it's not without its flaws. It's suitable for casual users who don't need a lot of processing power or are on a tight budget. However, if you're looking for a more robust and reliable smartphone, you might want to explore other options in the market. Keep your expectations in check, and you'll find the Realme N55 to be a decent entry-level device.",4.0 out of 5 stars
6894,"I recently purchased the Realme Narzo N55 in the Prime Black variant with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. While it has some impressive features, I have mixed feelings about this smartphone.Pros:1. **Super Fast Charging:** The 33W fast charging is a game-changer. It charges the phone rapidly, and I never have to worry about running out of battery during the day.2. **Stunning Camera:** The 64MP primary AI camera does deliver high-resolution photos with good clarity and color reproduction. It's a great choice for photography enthusiasts.3. **Ample Storage:** With 128GB of internal storage, I have plenty of space for all my apps, photos, and videos. No need to constantly delete files to make room.Cons:1. **Software Issues:** The phone occasionally suffers from software glitches. It freezes and lags at times, which can be frustrating. I hope Realme releases updates to address these issues.2. **Average Display:** The display is decent, but not exceptional. Colors are somewhat muted, and outdoor visibility could be better. It falls short compared to some competitors in this price range.3. **Build Quality:** While the phone feels sturdy, it's a bit on the bulky side. It's not the most comfortable phone to hold for extended periods, and the design could be more ergonomic.4. **Bloatware:** Realme preloads quite a bit of bloatware on the device. It takes up storage space and clutters the interface. Some of these apps cannot be uninstalled.Overall, the Realme Narzo N55 has its strengths, particularly in terms of fast charging and camera performance. However, it also has its fair share of shortcomings, including software issues and build quality. Whether it's the right phone for you depends on your priorities. If you value camera quality and fast charging, it might be worth considering. However, if you prioritize a smooth, hassle-free experience, you might want to explore other options in this price range.",3.0 out of 5 stars

7053,"TL:DR:1) If you are on a really tight budget, you can go for this phone.2) The HiOS is very bloated, buggy, laggy OS. Eventhough this is based on Android 12, using this phone feels like a using a prehistoric, old OS3) If you can spend 1k~2k more, go for other manufacturers.4) TECNO should ditch their HiOS and stick to Pure android OS if they want to see success in the Indian market. The OS is destroying the performance of the phone which has really good H/W specs for this price point.PRO's:1) 4GB/6GB RAM and 64GB/128GB storage.2) Decent Processor and Graphics for entry level gaming3) Large Display4) Front Single and Rear Dual FlashCON's:1) For a full charge from 0% to 100%, it will take 3 to 3.5 Hours2) The HiOS is very bloated, buggy, laggy OS. Eventhough this is based on Android 12, using this phone feels like a using a prehistoric, old OS3) Lots and Lots of junk apps that cannot be removed. Palm Store is the worst of the lot, It keeps sending notifications even when the app is disabled.4) The battery life suffers because of the bloated operating system and the unwanted applications that are running in the background.5) Lack of battery optimization features in HiOS6) Doubtful if this device will receive future Android OS updates in the future (13/14) as TECNO has not mentioned anything about this on their website.7) Camera is not upto the mark and do not expect great pictures.8) The S/W based RAM extension is useless as the 64GB/128GB ROM is slow and using this as the extended RAM is equivalent to using the Mechanical HDD as the extended RAM on Desktop computers.",3.0 out of 5 stars

7112,"I recently purchased the Realme Narzo 50i Prime in Dark Blue with 4GB RAM and 64GB Storage. While it has its strengths, it also falls short in some key areas.Pros:1. **Affordable Price**: The Realme Narzo 50i Prime is a budget-friendly phone, making it accessible for those looking for an affordable smartphone.2. **Decent Battery Life**: The 5000 mAh battery is one of the phone's standout features. It provides a good amount of juice to last through a day of moderate use.3. **Smooth Performance**: The octa-core processor handles everyday tasks and apps reasonably well, ensuring smooth operation for the most part.Cons:1. **Display Quality**: The display leaves much to be desired. Colors appear washed out, and the resolution is not sharp. It's a significant drawback, especially for media consumption.2. **Camera Performance**: The camera setup on this phone is rather basic. While it can capture decent photos in well-lit conditions, low-light photography is disappointing, and there's a noticeable lack of detail in images.3. **Limited RAM**: With only 4GB of RAM, the phone struggles with multitasking, and apps tend to reload frequently. This can be frustrating for users who like to switch between apps quickly.4. **Bloatware**: The Realme Narzo 50i Prime comes with a fair amount of pre-installed bloatware, which can be annoying. You'll need to spend some time uninstalling or disabling unnecessary apps.5. **Build Quality**: The phone feels a bit plasticky and not as sturdy as some of its competitors in the same price range.Overall, the Realme Narzo 50i Prime is an okay budget phone. If you're on a tight budget and prioritize battery life and basic functionality over display quality and camera performance, it might be worth considering. However, if you can stretch your budget a bit, there are better options available in the market that offer a more well-rounded smartphone experience.",3.0 out of 5 stars

7124,"Yesterday ordered this phone due to some urgency. Delivery received yesterday also. Configured the phone. It's a phone under 8k. Not good, but so so It is handy phone with 4+64 as well as there is Memory Card Tray also. Some of pre-installed games as well as snapchat, mojo, etc. were there, which needs time to uninstall. No Screen Guard / Tampered Glass on the phone screen. No Plascic Back Cover is there also, which really needed. The company can add hardware also for 'Fingerprint Sensor', this is the disadvantage of the phone, as the fingerpriint sensor is much more secured than the pass lock or face lock. Another thing you can't change the icon shaping, By default it is round, which I hate round shape icons on phone. I'm using Oneplus Nord 2T also, which has the features in software. Not comparing this Narzo with One plus, but they could provide this. Camera quality is so so. Now-a-days normal phone dialer is getting replaced by Google dialer, which has the call recording option, but in this case both of the parties can hear that their calls are getting recorded. They could bypass like Samsung, as Samsung has their own dialer with call recording facility.After one day of using it returned it to Amazon. Charging speed is very slow and incoming calls from any person is not clear. When I call back then it's ok. Not happy",4.0 out of 5 stars

The 5G capability is a great addition, providing faster data speeds and a smoother browsing experience. The overall performance is commendable, and it handles most applications and tasks with ease.However, I did encounter a camera issue after some usage. The camera app would show an error and close abruptly, which was frustrating. Initially, the customer service was not as helpful as I expected. They directed me to visit a service center, but unfortunately, these centers are not easily accessible in smaller towns. Fortunately, after a software update, the issue resolved itself, and the camera started functioning normally.Considering the price range, this smartphone competes well in the market. For users who primarily need a phone for calls and using light applications, this brand is worth considering. However, potential buyers should be aware of the possibility of encountering minor software glitches and limited accessibility to service centers in certain areas.In summary, the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G is a feature-rich smartphone with competitive specifications for its price. If you're a moderate user looking for a budget-friendly 5G-enabled phone, this is worth considering.",4.0 out of 5 stars
7195,"The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G has captured my attention with its blend of features, promising a solid performance in the 5G smartphone arena. Here's a comprehensive review of my experience with this device:Pros:Great Performance: The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G delivers on its promise of excellent performance, making multitasking, gaming, and app usage a smooth and seamless experience.Good Battery Life: With respectable battery endurance, the device keeps up with daily demands, ensuring you stay connected and entertained throughout the day.120Hz Display: The inclusion of a 120Hz display adds fluidity to interactions and enhances the visual experience, especially during gaming and scrolling.Reliable Camera Performance: The camera system of the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G proves dependable, capturing moments with clarity and accuracy.Premium Design: The device's design exudes a sense of premium craftsmanship, making it a stylish addition to your tech ensemble.Cons:Missing Charger in the Box: The absence of a charger in the package might be disappointing to users who expect a complete out-of-the-box experience.Minor Lag and Software Experience: While the device's performance is commendable, some users might notice minor lags across the UI, indicating room for software optimization to enhance the overall user experience.Lack of Night Mode in 4GB RAM Variant: Users of the 4GB RAM variant are left without the convenience of a night mode, potentially affecting low-light photography.Limited 5G Bands: The device supports only two 5G bands, which could limit its compatibility and usability in certain regions.Final Thoughts:The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G stands out for its notable strengths in performance, battery life, display quality, camera capabilities, and premium design. However, it's not without its shortcomings. The absence of a charger and the software experience's minor lags might be areas of concern for some users. Additionally, the lack of a night mode in the 4GB RAM variant and the limited 5G band support could impact certain user preferences and usage scenarios.In essence, the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G offers a commendable performance package, but its drawbacks should be considered in the context of your specific needs and priorities.",4.0 out of 5 stars

7219,"I recently purchased the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G in Stellar Green color, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The phone came with a travel adapter included in the box, which is a nice bonus. Let me share my experience with this device.Performance:The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G boasts the world's first Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 chipset, and it truly lives up to the hype. The 6GB RAM paired with the powerful processor ensures smooth multitasking and lag-free performance even with heavy applications and games. I haven't faced any stuttering or slowdowns, and the 5G capability provides super-fast internet connectivity.Display:The 120Hz refresh rate on this phone is a game-changer. Scrolling through apps and websites is incredibly smooth and fluid. The colors are vibrant, and the display quality is top-notch. Whether you're watching videos or playing games, the visual experience is simply outstanding.Storage:With 128GB of internal storage, there's plenty of space for all my apps, photos, and videos. Plus, if you need more storage, you can always expand it using a microSD card, which is a convenient feature.Battery Life:The battery life is impressive as well. Even with heavy usage, the phone manages to last through the day comfortably. The inclusion of a charger in the box is a thoughtful touch, and it supports fast charging, which ensures you can quickly top up your battery when needed.Camera:The camera performance is good for the price range. The 48MP main sensor captures detailed and sharp images, especially in well-lit conditions. The 5MP macro and 2MP depth sensors are decent additions, but they don't deliver exceptional results in challenging lighting situations.Build Quality:The phone feels sturdy and well-built in hand. The Stellar Green color variant looks stunning with its unique gradient design. The device is also relatively lightweight, making it comfortable to carry around.Value for Money:Considering the features and performance, I believe the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G offers incredible value for money. It competes with devices that are priced higher but delivers a comparable experience at a more affordable price point.Overall, I highly recommend the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G to anyone in the market for a powerful and feature-packed smartphone without breaking the bank. It's a well-rounded device that won't disappoint you, especially if you appreciate a smooth display, fast performance, and 5G connectivity.",5.0 out of 5 stars

7244,"As a retired (70s) person I needed a phone for Calling, Messaging, Entertainment, Browsing and Chrome casting. This phone is OK. But the weight of the phone gives pain in my fingers. Using Jio Router for WiFi. Although phone has dual band Wi-Fi capability, 2.4GHZ only gave a speed of 22 while 5GHZ gave full 30mbps. My old Realme phone only single band gives full 30 at the same spot. But overall it is still value for money for hard pressed oldies like me. On 22nd July, after 3 days of purchase I was pleased to receive MIUI 14 which is Android 13. Tested all features of Android 13 and so far no problems.I am writing again after 3 days of using MIUI 14 ie Android 13. Suddenly after 2 days my apps are behaving strangely. Calculator has no numeric pad, Battery Icon doesn't show %, drop down Status bar tray is showing only few icons. Immediately took it to MI service centre and new software was installed in 45 mts. and phone seems to work well with Android 13. Keeping fingers crossed. I have now visited MI Service Centre 3 times since my device was purchased on 19th July and still crashing. I hope MI will take up the matter seriously and not do a shoddy warranty job. I have not at all used the phone even for a single day.",4.0 out of 5 stars

7246,"Here is my honest review of the Redmi 12C smartphone:Pros:Good performance - The MediaTek Helio G85 processor and 4GB RAM provide smooth performance for day-to-day tasks and light gaming.Large display - It has a 6.71-inch HD+ display which is nice for watching videos and gaming. The teardrop notch is unobtrusive.Excellent battery life - With a large 5000mAh battery, the 12C can easily last 1.5-2 days of use on a single charge. Standby time is fantastic.Decent cameras - The 13MP rear and 5MP front cameras capture decent shots in good lighting conditions. The AI camera features are nice to have.Affordable price - Starting at just Rs. 8,999, the 12C offers good value considering the large display, battery and performance.Cons:Dated design - The thick bezels and plastic body make it look outdated compared to competitors. Build quality could be better.Average low-light photography - The cameras struggle in low light situations with visible noise. No ultra-wide or macro lens.Only 18W charging - Charging the large 5000mAh battery is slow with the included 18W charger. No support for faster charging.HD display - The display has only HD+ resolution (1600 x 720 pixels) resulting in less sharpness compared to Full HD displays.Overall, the Redmi 12C is a decent affordable smartphone for basic use and light gaming. It excels in battery life but has an outdated design and average camera performance. For the price, it's a good option for budget buyers who prioritize battery life and core performance. But those wanting better design or cameras can consider other options.",3.0 out of 5 stars
7247,"Camera does have 50 megapixel but you will get only portrait, normal, night, HDR and time lapse modes. I think night mode can be better.It is quite easy to use and is quite a sturdy one.It doesn't heat much but it can if you play high quality games which requires more functions like PUBG.Charging comes with normal one, there is no c type port and it takes its time to charge, no supercharge function.Appearance wise it's one of the best, you get great colour options and purple looks really good.I think this is a good budget phone.",4.0 out of 5 stars
7248,"Good built quality and appearance.Dislikes -many basic features that are only software related are also dropped for no reason.No new control center.Camera app don't have panorama, slow motion, document, AI modes. They are all software related not hardware which doesn't cost anything.Same way gallery editor is restricted of many common features like auto adjust image, colour focus filters etc.Auto brightness has some difficulty in adjustment.No live wallpaper,no always on display.Home screen grid is limited to only 4x4 and 5x5 in such a big screen. It should be atleast upto 5X7 option.No option to pin window or floating window, or split screen app option from recent menu.Hardware side -IR blaster, gyroscope sensor for compass, proximity sensor are missing for cost cutting.Type C charging port also dropped which is unbelievable.Extreme thick bazels and big lower space is just increased the size of phone.The weight is more than expected and size is also very big (even bigger than my redmi note 10 pro). God knows the reason behind making such bulky oversize phones. You cannot find any smaller size phone in the market.Screen quality, sound quality, camera quality are acceptable at this price range. No issue faced.Fingerprint sensor is at very high position, difficult to reach, and frequently you will touch camera lens instead of FP sensor because of the placement.Conclusion:On overall, it's basically a good hardware side purchase at this price range with very basic features (especially for elders and family members. But again too bulky for elders).On software side complete disappointment from MIUI for removing very basic features from its applications for no good reason.",3.0 out of 5 stars

7250,"I recently had the chance to explore the Redmi 12C in Matte Black, and my experience has been a combination of both positive and not-so-positive aspects. Here's a detailed breakdown:Pros:High-Performance Processor: The inclusion of the Mediatek Helio G85 processor brings a noticeable boost in performance, ensuring smoother multitasking and responsiveness.Excellent Battery Life: The battery life on the Redmi 12C is certainly a standout feature. It holds up impressively even during extended use, reducing the need for frequent charges.Cons:Display Performance: While the display is good overall, it falls short of being exceptional. Colors and clarity are satisfactory, but I expected a bit more vibrancy and sharpness.Sound Quality: Unfortunately, the sound quality did not meet my expectations. The audio output lacks the depth and richness I anticipated, which can impact the overall multimedia experience.MIUI OS: The MIUI operating system brings its own set of challenges. The user experience could be smoother, and certain functionalities, such as the contact search not showing recently added contacts and a delay in recent call history list updates, have been noticeable issues.Camera Performance: The camera's performance is average, offering acceptable results but not quite meeting the high standards set by other devices in this category.The Redmi 12C brings a mix of features to the table, with some aspects that shine and others that leave room for improvement. The high-performance processor and remarkable battery life are commendable, providing an enhanced user experience. However, areas like display vibrancy, sound quality, and the MIUI OS experience could use further refinement. While the camera captures moments adequately, it doesn't deliver exceptional results. For those seeking a budget-friendly option with a balance of strengths and weaknesses, the Redmi 12C could be considered. Keep in mind the trade-offs and decide based on your priorities.",4.0 out of 5 stars

7314,"So Earlier I posted my 2 weeks review about this phone,now it has been one month since i bought it and this is what I found great and not so great about this phoneI'll write about my experience now1.One plus UI obviously is really good with almost zero bloatwares in it, The UI is really good and does not hang2.For charging- Yes this phone comes with a 80 Watt charger but supports upto 67W charging still making it go from 0-100 percent in less than an hour3.Battery lasts really good for a normal user, I have tested myself by going outside around 9 am at 100 percent battery and returning home late at night with still about 35% charge4.The phone has a plastic back and my variant i.e pastel lime is really good, the look is really premium5.Great sounding stereo speakers probably the loudest and clearest in this price segment,6. Display is IPS LCD not AMOLED which can be kind of a con for this phone but still being an IPS LCD it does not disappoints the standard is there.7. IPS LCD is 120hz which is very smooth but on some applications it automatically locks on 60hz like netflix youtube and many more apps.8. One plus has promised to give this phone 2 major android updates and 3 years of security updates you can find more about on their websiteA. Performance and camera1. It comes in with a snapdragon 695 5g processor in it which is pretty common in this budget2. Gaming is good as per the price segment, You can play Call of duty mobile(Smooth),apex legends and genshin impact smoothly on low settings obviously update-BGMI works on HD settings and MAX frame rate3. It has 8 gb ram in it and 8 gb is more than sufficient for normal use and more over it has expandable ram as well upto 8 gb, so what you can do is make your phone into8+8 ram4. Camera quality was really bad at first but an update which came around 2nd week of may fixed the camera by a lot. Daylight photos have gotten good HDR and colors are greatAlthough it does not provide Punchy colors in photos , its not a flaw for me because i dont like punchy color5. Night performance for camera can still be better.6.Video recording is available at only 1080p@30fps due to limitations of the processor, rest the video capture works great7.There is a slow mo feature as well also front+back camera recording simultaneouslyConclusionThere is a lot for improvement on this phone and the journey has just started , Lets hope that the updates can fix some of the issues and bring us new features as wellFor me I am a normal user with a little bit of gaming, I can rate this phone around 8/10 (top 5 in this range)Obviously there are better options but You can give this phone a chance as well :D🐐🐐",4.0 out of 5 stars
7315,"I have been using this phone for a week now and I am very impressed with its performance and features. The phone is sleek and lightweight, with a beautiful chromatic gray color that changes hue depending on the light. The display is bright and crisp, with a smooth 90Hz refresh rate that makes scrolling and gaming a pleasure. The camera is also amazing, with a 64MP main sensor that captures stunning details and colors. The night mode is especially impressive, as it can take clear and bright photos even in low-light conditions. The battery life is also great, as it can last for a full day of moderate to heavy use. The phone supports fast charging with the included 30W charger, which can charge the phone from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. The phone also has 5G connectivity, which makes browsing and streaming faster and smoother. The phone runs on OxygenOS 12, which is based on Android 12. The software is clean and user-friendly, with no bloatware or ads. It also has some useful features like dark mode, always-on display, Zen mode, and more. The phone also has a headphone jack, which is rare these days. The sound quality is decent, both from the speakers and the earphones. The phone also has a fingerprint scanner on the power button, which is fast and reliable. The phone also has face unlock, which works well in most situations.Overall, I am very happy with this phone and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a budget-friendly 5G smartphone with great performance and features. It is definitely worth the price and it offers a lot of value for money. It is one of the best phones I have ever used and I don't regret buying it at all.",4.0 out of 5 stars

True 5G with 10-11 5G bands, as minimum 8 5G bands are necessary for better and stable 5G network coverage.5. As expected, disappointment on camera has been fixed with 2nd software updates in the 1st week of May 2023.Cons1. Slightly less bright display may irritate in sunlight.2. The worst Google dailer that won't allow silent call recording, to directly place a videos call without sharing personal data on Google meet app i.e. without signing in to another Google spyware especially when two SIMs are installed.3. The tall & 200 gms, a bulky smartphone would require both the hand for operation for most of the people.4. One plus has not clarified anything about future updates. But users can expect 2 Android updates and 3 years of security update.5. Existing 2-3 uninstallable bloatwares could have been avoided to make the Oxygen OS = (Colour OS - bloatwares).6. Some youtubers may say it doesn't support 4K videos. It is upto you, how many times you watch 4K videos online that requires 5-7 times of data? If you are comfortable with 5-7 times extra data recharge, definitely you should look at 4K supporting devices.7. Does not justify it's ₹ 20k price. Brand has cleverly started with the minimum 8GB varient to earn from this unwanted & forcefull specs.",4.0 out of 5 stars

7318,"I recently upgraded to the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G in Pastel Lime, and I've been thoroughly impressed with its performance and features. Here's what I love about it:**Pros:**1. **Affordable 5G:** The inclusion of 5G capabilities in a phone at this price point is a huge plus. Streaming and downloading content is lightning-fast, and I'm future-proofed for upcoming advancements in connectivity.2. **Sleek Design:** The Pastel Lime color is unique and adds a refreshing touch to the device. The slim profile and lightweight build make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.3. **Smooth Performance:** With 8GB of RAM, multitasking is a breeze. The phone handles various apps and tasks simultaneously without any lag or slowdowns.4. **Ample Storage:** The 128GB storage provides enough room for all my apps, photos, and videos. Plus, the option to expand storage via microSD card is a thoughtful addition.5. **Impressive Display:** The AMOLED display offers vibrant colors and deep blacks, enhancing my media consumption experience. The Full HD+ resolution ensures crisp visuals, whether I'm watching videos or browsing the web.**Cons:**1. **Average Camera Performance:** While the camera setup is decent, it doesn't quite match the quality of flagship devices. Photos in well-lit conditions turn out great, but low-light performance could be improved.2. **Plastic Back:** While the plastic back keeps the device lightweight, it may not feel as premium as glass-backed phones. A good quality case helps mitigate this, though.3. **Battery Life:** The battery life is good, but not exceptional. It easily lasts me through a day of moderate use, but I'd appreciate a bit more juice for heavy usage days.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G offers a compelling package of features at an affordable price. It's a great option for users who want to experience 5G connectivity without breaking the bank. The design, performance, and display quality are its standout features, making it an excellent value for money. While there are a few areas for improvement, the overall experience this phone provides is truly remarkable.",4.0 out of 5 stars

7334,"As a retired (70s) person I needed a phone for Calling, Messaging, Entertainment, Browsing and Chrome casting. This phone is OK. But the weight of the phone gives pain in my fingers. Using Jio Router for WiFi. Although phone has dual band Wi-Fi capability, 2.4GHZ only gave a speed of 22 while 5GHZ gave full 30mbps. My old Realme phone only single band gives full 30 at the same spot. But overall it is still value for money for hard pressed oldies like me. On 22nd July, after 3 days of purchase I was pleased to receive MIUI 14 which is Android 13. Tested all features of Android 13 and so far no problems.I am writing again after 3 days of using MIUI 14 ie Android 13. Suddenly after 2 days my apps are behaving strangely. Calculator has no numeric pad, Battery Icon doesn't show %, drop down Status bar tray is showing only few icons. Immediately took it to MI service centre and new software was installed in 45 mts. and phone seems to work well with Android 13. Keeping fingers crossed. I have now visited MI Service Centre 3 times since my device was purchased on 19th July and still crashing. I hope MI will take up the matter seriously and not do a shoddy warranty job. I have not at all used the phone even for a single day.",4.0 out of 5 stars

7336,"Here is my honest review of the Redmi 12C smartphone:Pros:Good performance - The MediaTek Helio G85 processor and 4GB RAM provide smooth performance for day-to-day tasks and light gaming.Large display - It has a 6.71-inch HD+ display which is nice for watching videos and gaming. The teardrop notch is unobtrusive.Excellent battery life - With a large 5000mAh battery, the 12C can easily last 1.5-2 days of use on a single charge. Standby time is fantastic.Decent cameras - The 13MP rear and 5MP front cameras capture decent shots in good lighting conditions. The AI camera features are nice to have.Affordable price - Starting at just Rs. 8,999, the 12C offers good value considering the large display, battery and performance.Cons:Dated design - The thick bezels and plastic body make it look outdated compared to competitors. Build quality could be better.Average low-light photography - The cameras struggle in low light situations with visible noise. No ultra-wide or macro lens.Only 18W charging - Charging the large 5000mAh battery is slow with the included 18W charger. No support for faster charging.HD display - The display has only HD+ resolution (1600 x 720 pixels) resulting in less sharpness compared to Full HD displays.Overall, the Redmi 12C is a decent affordable smartphone for basic use and light gaming. It excels in battery life but has an outdated design and average camera performance. For the price, it's a good option for budget buyers who prioritize battery life and core performance. But those wanting better design or cameras can consider other options.",3.0 out of 5 stars
7337,"Camera does have 50 megapixel but you will get only portrait, normal, night, HDR and time lapse modes. I think night mode can be better.It is quite easy to use and is quite a sturdy one.It doesn't heat much but it can if you play high quality games which requires more functions like PUBG.Charging comes with normal one, there is no c type port and it takes its time to charge, no supercharge function.Appearance wise it's one of the best, you get great colour options and purple looks really good.I think this is a good budget phone.",4.0 out of 5 stars
7338,"Good built quality and appearance.Dislikes -many basic features that are only software related are also dropped for no reason.No new control center.Camera app don't have panorama, slow motion, document, AI modes. They are all software related not hardware which doesn't cost anything.Same way gallery editor is restricted of many common features like auto adjust image, colour focus filters etc.Auto brightness has some difficulty in adjustment.No live wallpaper,no always on display.Home screen grid is limited to only 4x4 and 5x5 in such a big screen. It should be atleast upto 5X7 option.No option to pin window or floating window, or split screen app option from recent menu.Hardware side -IR blaster, gyroscope sensor for compass, proximity sensor are missing for cost cutting.Type C charging port also dropped which is unbelievable.Extreme thick bazels and big lower space is just increased the size of phone.The weight is more than expected and size is also very big (even bigger than my redmi note 10 pro). God knows the reason behind making such bulky oversize phones. You cannot find any smaller size phone in the market.Screen quality, sound quality, camera quality are acceptable at this price range. No issue faced.Fingerprint sensor is at very high position, difficult to reach, and frequently you will touch camera lens instead of FP sensor because of the placement.Conclusion:On overall, it's basically a good hardware side purchase at this price range with very basic features (especially for elders and family members. But again too bulky for elders).On software side complete disappointment from MIUI for removing very basic features from its applications for no good reason.",3.0 out of 5 stars

7340,"I recently had the chance to explore the Redmi 12C in Matte Black, and my experience has been a combination of both positive and not-so-positive aspects. Here's a detailed breakdown:Pros:High-Performance Processor: The inclusion of the Mediatek Helio G85 processor brings a noticeable boost in performance, ensuring smoother multitasking and responsiveness.Excellent Battery Life: The battery life on the Redmi 12C is certainly a standout feature. It holds up impressively even during extended use, reducing the need for frequent charges.Cons:Display Performance: While the display is good overall, it falls short of being exceptional. Colors and clarity are satisfactory, but I expected a bit more vibrancy and sharpness.Sound Quality: Unfortunately, the sound quality did not meet my expectations. The audio output lacks the depth and richness I anticipated, which can impact the overall multimedia experience.MIUI OS: The MIUI operating system brings its own set of challenges. The user experience could be smoother, and certain functionalities, such as the contact search not showing recently added contacts and a delay in recent call history list updates, have been noticeable issues.Camera Performance: The camera's performance is average, offering acceptable results but not quite meeting the high standards set by other devices in this category.The Redmi 12C brings a mix of features to the table, with some aspects that shine and others that leave room for improvement. The high-performance processor and remarkable battery life are commendable, providing an enhanced user experience. However, areas like display vibrancy, sound quality, and the MIUI OS experience could use further refinement. While the camera captures moments adequately, it doesn't deliver exceptional results. For those seeking a budget-friendly option with a balance of strengths and weaknesses, the Redmi 12C could be considered. Keep in mind the trade-offs and decide based on your priorities.",4.0 out of 5 stars

7397,"I like quite a lot about this phone. In terms of hardware, it's an excellent phone at its price. It has 5G, 8 GBs of memory, 256 GB of storage, and pretty decent processor to boot. The hardware specs are neat.So far, I haven't had a good time with the camera. The pictures often come out blurry, which means that autofocus isn't very quick. Redmi's older note phones have better cameras.My biggest disappointment with this phone is the UI. MIUI is a terrible OS if you're into customization and other things. Firstly, don't expect a lot of features that were offered. Xiaomi locks many of the MIUI features for China only, but also locks them out of lower-end devices like this. Secondly, they have disabled full-screen gestures if you're using a custom launcher. The default MIUI launcher is terrible as well and just doesn't look good. For an individual who is accustomed to the stock Android experience, the MIUI 14 has been a dismal experience after almost 20 days of using the phone.I really want to give the phone a higher rating, but the software is preventing me from doing so.

7456,"I am enjoying 5g access for first time.This device is entry level by amazon and redmi collabration.I bought this for less than 8k with my old redmi 9a exchange offer.Phone specs for 4gb ram - I have good OTT apps and screen is good.Usage of 1.7Gb ram by OS is too much though.I hope upcoming updates fix this.Lock screen is finger print -Its good upgrade for me.Experience using other launcher and keypads - I use nova launcher and microsoft swift keypad- gesture control is blocked when you opt for third party launchers - keyboard looks perfect with big screen.There is 3 button at bottom which you cant remove.Bloatware is plenty - I didn't sign in google account immediately - I uninstall most apps.I feel battery drain with my 5g usage ,But yeah great hotspot for my laptop or tablet.Gaming :Not much into gaming - I play crosswords , spelling games- hardly any issue when playing . This phone is not for graphic intensive games. But Okay for subway surfer , temple run games kind of games .Issues :I am waiting for UI updates to fix landscape screen crashing. And Also Google play doesn't load up sometimes- need to reset or clear cache .Charging takes 2hrs nearly- I end up charging twice a day.Speaker felt weird for few days- then I got adapted to it.I have mic issues when taking call in speaker mode.Final verdict :If looking for basic phone with 5g processor - UI needs bug fixes though - buy it if you know what you are signing up.",4.0 out of 5 stars
7457,"I like quite a lot about this phone. In terms of hardware, it's an excellent phone at its price. It has 5G, 8 GBs of memory, 256 GB of storage, and pretty decent processor to boot. The hardware specs are neat.So far, I haven't had a good time with the camera. The pictures often come out blurry, which means that autofocus isn't very quick. Redmi's older note phones have better cameras.My biggest disappointment with this phone is the UI. MIUI is a terrible OS if you're into customization and other things. Firstly, don't expect a lot of features that were offered. Xiaomi locks many of the MIUI features for China only, but also locks them out of lower-end devices like this. Secondly, they have disabled full-screen gestures if you're using a custom launcher. The default MIUI launcher is terrible as well and just doesn't look good. For an individual who is accustomed to the stock Android experience, the MIUI 14 has been a dismal experience after almost 20 days of using the phone.I really want to give the phone a higher rating, but the software is preventing me from doing so. Overall, I think it's solid hardware for the price, but it's probably going to better with a custom rom.",3.0 out of 5 stars

They take okay pictures, nothing fancy.In short, the Redmi 12 5G is a good phone with a speedy processor, nice looks, and okay cameras.

7516,"It's been 7 days since I started using it. In this 1 week my experience with Lava Blaze 5G was more bad than good. Although it wasn't worse as some might think. So, let's start the review from where it needs to be.Delivery and Unboxing- The package I received was really the worst in my entire life. There was only the amazon cardboard box but that's it. It was very wore out, loose and completely opened from one side. On top of that there was no foam, bubble wrap or thermocol sheet at all to protect from accidental shocks or any damage. At first impression it felt like my package has been tampered but thankfully that's not the case. I would request amazon to improve their packaging and I would like to ask about why their packaging quality got degraded over the years. I didn't pay 12k rupees to just receive whatever garbage you can give me. It was an entire months hard earned money. When I started unboxing it everything was there safe and sound. Now I took a sigh of relief. What made me more happy was after setting up the phone I saw the battery was 56%. Every phone I bought till now used to have 49% or below. This is the first ever phone that gives 56% out of the box. Even more exciting thing was this phone gives clean Android with no bloatware and limited features too. But let me inform you that this is not Stock Android. It just uses Google apps and doesn't have any mp3 player, video player or even a gallery of it's own. I wonder if they really have to give only Google apps then they could've provided Google Gallery. Also Lava is using a custom skin but it was hidden so brilliantly that you can't find it even if you wanted to. The customization features of Blaze 5G proved that.Battery and Charging- 2nd thing about this phone that impressed me. After unboxing it I charged it upto 79% only and did normal tasks like watching Amazon prime, using Google, phone calls, SMS, WhatsApp etc and after 43 hours and 31 minute the battery was 14%. I really was shocked to see this. Imagine how much time it would take to fully deplete the battery. Also, what could've happened if I charged the phone to 100%. But let me tell you it's not because of the enormous 5000mAh battery. This great backup is only because of Lava using Mediatek Dimensity 700 and how well they optimised the battery. Also the clean Android plays a huge role too as there are no apps that will suck the battery in background. Additionally, the 720x1600p display is also another reason for it as it will do less processing compared to a Full HD+ display. That's why it will consume less power. But in gaming I will say it's same as any other phone. Battery will deplete faster and it also depends on what games you play. They give you a 12W charger in the box but the Lava Customer Care confirmed me that Blaze 5G supports upto 15W charging. So if you already have a 15W charger in home you can easily fast charge it. The 12W charger takes more than 3 hours for charging 0 to 100%. Using a 15W charger will make it a bit faster. Expect upto 2 hours for fully charging with a 15W charger.Display- This phone has a 6.52 inch, 720x1600 (HD+) 90Hz IPS LCD panel, 20:9 aspect ratio with ~269ppi. But don't be disappointed by hearing the resolution numbers. I had seen IRL it feels same as any 1080p display. There is no pixelation, no sluggish-ness and picture quality is great. 90Hz refresh rate makes the phone feel very fast too. Also, the display is very clear in direct sunlight outside. In general the phone is somehow having more nits than anyone else. Just decrease your brightness to the lowest and you'll see that Blaze 5G is still bright than other phones of any price you say. Now this was oddly satisfying to me.CPU and Performance- This phone uses a Mediatek Dimensity 700, 6GB RAM and Mali-G57 MC2 GPU. I has been gaming on this phone since the day I received it and it really impressed me in gaming. I play Eversoul, Brawl Stars, T3 Arena, Asphalt 9, The 7 Deadly Sins Grand Cross, Sword Art Online: Integral Factor and Tasokare Hotel. Eversoul, Asphalt 9 and T3 Arena are actually heavy games and will make your phone heat in no time. They do lag on budget phones and perform badly. But playing these games on Blaze 5G was wonderful. They run really very smooth and have no lags, jitters or any frame drops at all and I play entire day but the temps of this phone never reached 40°. It reached maximum 36°-37° till now. I really loved how Lava worked on the thermals and it doesn't warm at all and always stays at room temps. Let me tell you that just opening Eversoul makes my Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G overheat like crazy. It takes only 1-2 minute to get 58.9°. Yes, I switched to Lava Blaze 5G from a 37k S20 FE 5G and that too because of overheating, thermal throttling and even though S20 FE 5G is equipped with a Snapdragon 865 but it still lags while gaming. Some games has started crashing recently too on it. Thankfully Blaze 5G doesn't have any issues and is very stable. I really loved Blaze 5G giving the option of virtual memory too. But let me tell you that virtual memory is only useful for devices under 4GB of RAM. It won't be any helpful for 6GB and above RAM so I had disabled it after first boot. On top of that you will lose a chunk of your storage unnecessarily. I will suggest everyone to use your Blaze 5G with virtual memory disabled. The memory management in this phone has been another impressive thing. If you minimize the apps or games and open it after 30 minutes, it will resume from where you left and didn't reload. Where my more expensive S20 FE 5G sometimes reloads the apps and games.Audio- This phone gave me mixed feelings in the matter of audio. Playing music with YT music will feel something else, playing music with Google Files will make you feel something else and facebook, WhatsApp or YouTube will give another kind of feeling. Sometimes it can sound hollow, sometimes it will sound suppress but sometimes it will sound great. It depends on what app you're using and if the music is a mp3 file or you're streaming online. The presence of 3.5mm jack was really impressive too. You can use Bluetooth Neckband, TWS earbuds, 3.5mm earphones and Type-C earphones. I have used pTron Bassbuds Duo, KDM A-2 neckband and Core Type-C earphones. It support it all. A really great thing that you can't get in 200k 300k rupees phone. I really enjoyed the multi support for audio. Otherwise the lack of 3.5mm jack is becoming very normal in budget phones too.Camera- The photos and videos are exactly what made me hate this phone. This phone comes with Triple Camera AI Setup. Primary one is 50 Megapixels, 2nd module is a 2 Megapixels Macro and 3rd one is not mentioned anywhere but when I asked the Lava Customer Care they told me it is a 0.2 Megapixel VGA module. There is no depth sensor or telephoto lens. A lot of people will dislike this setup but it was good for me as I don't use the telephoto very often. Both the photos and videos are very bad. Sharpness is what a budget phone will give you but there is no HDR, perfect white balance, and while shooting in broad daylight it will overexpose everything. It extremely overexposed my indoor lighting too and I use only 1 CFL bulb for each room. Take this statement as a fact that this camera module will overexpose even a single photon. Let alone broad daylight situation. The colors will be a bit washed out too. I took a photo of my Hero Sprint cycle which is red color but the photo was showing light red/orange-ish color. Software updates of Lava is like non-existent so no idea when we will receive one but these canera issues can be fixed by a software upgrade for sure. But let me tell you that even though Lava advertised Blaze 5G can shoot 2K EIS but that's not the exact matter. You can use EIS in 480p recording too. I have done that and I still don't know if it's a bug or feature but I had shot footages of 480p non-eis, 480p eis, 720p non-eis, 720p eis, 1080p non-eis, 1080p eis, 1440p non-eis and 1440p eis. Glad they didn't lock the EIS function to only 2K. I have attached all the photos so you can take a good look at how both the front and rear camera perform at day and night.Connectivity- Again it impressed me and this time it was in the matter of connectivity. I have used both of my airtel 5G SIM AND THIS PHONE RUNS DUAL 5G 🤩🤩🤩 I was able to use mobile data from both of these SIM cards and I was getting the expected 5G speed. It also runs dual 4G and dual 3G too. Something that even the extremely high priced phones like Samsung S23 Ultra and iPhone 14 series and 15 series don't provide at all but this Lava 5G did it and it really performs flawlessly. WiFi didn't have any disconnection issues at all and the Bluetooth was able to transfer 4GB of data a little bit faster which I never expected. Lava has played some serious games here with the dual 5G and such capable Bluetooth module. Hotspot didn't face any issues too. Sharing files over both hotspot and Nearby Share was flawlessly fast. Kudos to Lava for providing a connectivity that challenges phones (not so) worth of lakhs.Final Verdict- So... Should you buy this phone or not? I will say yes and will recommend it but it also depends from person to person. It was very depressing to see that they don't have any service center in Bhubaneswar, Odisha too. Thankfully they compensated this by providing home service so an agent of their will come to your home and will fix everything but if something serious is found, then they'll take the device to service center. Overall this device outstands everything and I have seen a test where Blaze 5G beats S22 Ultra in 5G speed test. So undoubtedly a great device but it is having a huge headroom for improvements.Thank you and have a nice day 😊",4.0 out of 5 stars
7517,"PROS- 5G full speed, no overheating, good battery life, clean UI, no ads. Recommended for parents or older people.CONS- Camera is average, Bugs are there, Build quality is average, Not for gaming.Camera: There is a bug with Android 13, the camera is taking pictures by itself, else than that camera is like a 10k phone. So nothing good but photos look 50 megapixel. It is good enough. In artificial and low light you might need to fix things a bit but it's good.Display: This is unusual but this phone has really good display. It's IPS LCD but the quality is like a 15k phone, so it's pretty decent. Watching content is the most I use in this phone.Also 90hz display soothes the eye.Charging & Battery Life: charging is slow but worth it. Battery life is good. Like this will last for 1 day atleast if you don't play games.Gaming- THIS PHONE IS NOT FOR GAMING(LIKE BGMI, CODM) . Small games work flawlessly.THE UI: ONE OF THE BEST REASONS TO RECOMMEND THIS TO PARENTS BECAUSE THE UI IS OPTIMISED TO FEEL THAT ITS MADE FOR AN OLD PERSON, LIKE LITERALLY SOMEONE MADE THE ICONS BIG BY DEFAULT.( this is a very good thing because you don't have to toggle too much)Bugs: YES THERE ARE BUGS IN THIS PHONE, BUT IS IT NOT USABLE? NO, I DON'T FEEL BUGS AFFECT THAT MUCH.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Pros a mobile needs to be presenablle and comfort to hold and work without much of fuss.On this count it is a PASS.Now what surprise me that a Android 13 upgrade was on the card.this thrilled me immensely as Lava was silent on this aspect.A minimum of 2-3 upgrades on Android are a must.Processor I also working well. 5G Speed was at par with other mobiles in this price bracket.Infact this is the cheapest 5Gvset which is holding its Head high. looks are average.In Cons battery charge is slow which if provided with a fast Charging would have enhanced it's utility.All future mobiles without this enhanced utility would have been most welcome.My comments are keeping with its price bracket.All in all I am at peace with this buy Well done LAVA,you have done it",4.0 out of 5 stars

7527,"Pros:Sleek Design: The Glass Blue colour is gorgeous and gives the phone a premium look and feel. It's a head-turner for sure.Smooth Performance: With 8GB of RAM and the snappy UFS 2.2 storage, this phone handles multitasking with ease. Apps load quickly, and there's no noticeable lag in daily usage.5G Connectivity: Being 5G-ready is a big plus, ensuring that I'm future-proofed for faster data speeds as 5G networks become more widespread.Impressive Camera: The 50MP AI triple camera setup delivers stunning photos. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the shots, especially in well-lit conditions. The AI enhancements add a nice touch to photos.Expandable RAM: The option to expand the RAM up to 16GB is a unique feature that ensures the phone's longevity in terms of performance.Clean Android: No bloatware is a blessing. The phone runs on a clean Android interface, which not only feels snappier but also offers a clutter-free experience.Included Charger: It's always great when a charger is included in the box. It saves the hassle of buying one separately.Cons:Software Updates: Although the phone runs on a clean Android interface, the frequency and longevity of software updates can be a concern. Regular updates are crucial for security and performance improvements.Camera in Low Light: While the camera performs well in well-lit conditions, it struggles in low-light environments. The photos tend to have noise and lack detail in such scenarios.Not for Gamers: While the phone handles day-to-day tasks well, it may not be the best choice for hardcore gamers due to its mid-range chipset.",5.0 out of 5 stars

No bloatware and stock android6. And finally, Good battery with day day performance as my wife don't play game.I am truly happy to share that this phone has exceeded my expectations in every corner. Actually, I was little skeptical about the screen as it is only HD plus, however to my surprise, it is best HD plus display I have every seen. Not much difference. Camera also exceeded my expectations, though little improvement is required in white exposure. And surprisingly, it is from indian brand Lava. Long live Lava!! Keep doing great. I am owing samsung but I swear If Lava keeps doing this, my next phone will be from Lava. Everyone in my family and friends praised this. My true words.Few things which was a true surprise as I didn't expect at all in this price segment:-1. Haptics (best means best, even better than premium segment phones)2. Screen color reproduction is sometimes equal to that of Amoled, though not always. But believe me HD plus display will not be a regret.3. awesome Ram management and UFC 2.1 will definitely make your feel of using a premium phones4. Looks - not even 25 to 30k phone will come near to this.Though, some cons are also there-1. Slow charger - takes around 3 hours to charge battery, though battery backup is Superb.2. Video lags in 2k 60 FPS, though work fine in 1080 60 fps. This really requires efforts from Lava as it is possible to improve via update.3. Camera white exposure and portrait mode requires improvements.4. Background stream - in review videos, option of background stream like YouTube is shown, however in reality, I am unable to see this. Please get this done with an update.5. Last but not least - place of fingerprint sensor or power key sometimes feel uncomfortable for new user. Though, not an issue after some days use.If the above issues are possible to resolve, please resolve Lava.No phone can come close to this pure stock android experience in this price range.However, the way you have made a come back in indian market is Superb.

However, one can use pro mode to adjust exposure to some extent. At times for some modes, you may see pixelation. The macro shots taken in Sunlight are highly exposed. The long shots in day and night are good. Video has EIS, Slow motion and Time Lapse and screen recording options. Music Sound, Call quality and call recording is decent. Display is overall good. Almost pure android 12. I could test Airtel 5G and Reliance Jio 5G on this phone and I got speed upto 300 mbps on Airtel 5G and 500 mbps speed on Reliance Jio 5G.

Inspite of being prime member, still there was a delay in delivery and took three days, poor Amazon customer services, the same repeated standard reverts to everyone, no empathy, sympathy and special treatment to prime members also for early delivery, Amazon is cheating the customers inviting to become prime members, not acceptable from Amazon.

7596,"I got this phone delivered the next day of ordering, as part of prime day sale. Writing this review after few days of use.Well the first impression about the back panel color is - it's blue rather than green! nevertheless it looks cool and feels premium. The glass finish is shiny, but I would recommend to use the rubber back cover that comes with the box. But you might have to invest to buy a transparent, bumper cover in the long run.Display - It is awesome as I keep looking the phone just to admire the different wall papers and text settings, etc. Colors are deep and rich! Almost zero bloatware.Battery - For a mild to medium user like me(about 3 Hrs of active usage), the battery has lasted for more than 24 Hrs. Also the fast charger works as expected. Full charge in less than an hour.Audio - Yes, I do miss the 3.5MM Jack especially as my old phone had that feature. However, the call quality through the device and through the BT earphones are ultra clear. No default music player app provided as in Samsung devices, but YT music/Spotify can fulfill your music needs. Hearing songs through built in speakers was goodIt comes with other bells and whistles like - favorite contacts widget, customizable always-on-display and in-display fingerprint sensor , battery saving mode, etc. I particularly like the fingerprint animation settings.Performance - well for my moderate usage I have not faced any problems so far. Stutter free scrolling, and apps are getting loaded in a jiffy and all the apps work smoothly; notifications work very well. Videos played well. Actually, nothing to complain here in these few days of usage.Camera - Honestly not able to test it in different conditions, but both day and night photos seem to come out well. Video calls quality is also great.Also, the phone does not feel heavy to hold. Even people with small hands should not have a problem in holding and operating the phone.I hope I can write a detailed review after few weeks of thorough usage. Thanks!",4.0 out of 5 stars

It could benefit from improvements in capturing detail and maintaining color accuracy.IP Rating: In comparison to some competitors, the absence of a higher IP rating for water and dust resistance feels like a missed opportunity.Final Verdict:The OnePlus Nord 3 5G impresses with its premium design, powerful performance, and excellent primary camera. It's a true contender in the mid-range segment. However, a few drawbacks, such as the ultra-wide camera's performance and the lack of a higher IP rating, prevent it from achieving a perfect score. If you're in the market for a well-rounded smartphone that balances style, performance, and camera capabilities, the Nord 3 is definitely worth considering.",4.0 out of 5 stars
7598,"Since it's my first day. So, I haven't found any difficulty in using it. Just good phone. Since I am using OnePlus from last 4 years this phone is good but it can't be a flagship killer phone overall. Because it's camera and pictures quality are not such good. But it's processor is good which is mediatek dimensity 9000. So, it's performance is good as expected. I have buyed this phones 8GB Ram and 128GB storage version. Yes, it's good but price should be little much low at least 30,000. Or if it's price is 33999 then it's camera quality must be good enough and since after facing all prons and cons it good phone.

7611,"One good problem OnePlus has is that people expect the company to blow their minds.It doesn't happen any longer.I was recommended Iqoo Neo 7 pro for same price but went with this.Although Iqoo would have better performance, battery etc but you can't discount the CLASS OnePlus has.Camera has a boosted and social media friendly camera. Colour science is accurate but it'll make reds more red, blue even bluer etc, that's what you need anyways.Of course night mode stunningly good. I took some samples where a naked eye can't see any details but the device captures without any noise with accurate colour reproduction.

Otherwise battery will last about a complete day with normal usage.

7641,"This review is based on just one day of usage.Likes1.The hardware- the hardware is topnotch for the price. The chipset is fairly decent, cameras are good (not great, but usable images), speakers are above average. Screen is also perfectly usable. Full hd screen with 90 hz refresh rate. Fingerprint sensor is accurate and quick. No heating issues as of now (I haven't used the phone extensively; see other reviews for heating).2. Charging- it is the best feature of this product. The charging is truly best in class. Half filled the phone from zero in just under 30 minutes.3. Battery- again very good. The chipset being sub-flagship is very conservative in battery consumption. As a result, phone easily last more than a day. I charged it yesterday at noon and I still have around 30% left at 7 pm today.Mediocre1. Camera- not best in class. The back camera is decent under good lighting. But quickly looses it when the light fades. Night photography is not good. Selfie camera too is not very good, but still give usable photos in good lighting. Again, I bought this phone for my mom, photography is not her strong point! So, it's perfectly fine for her as it gets the job done most of the times.2. Features- the system has good features such as overnight charging, minimised screen, gesture shortcuts etc. But the overall experience of the UI is ruined by ads, which is the number one problem I have with this phone.Dislikes1. Ads ads ads. Everywhere you look, there are ads. There are ads in the app launcher, there are ads each time you install an app, there are ads when you clear cache using the native cleaner app. There are apps installed on its own without even giving permission. I spend so much time removing all the unnecessary apps and after sometime, some of them came back. The realme app store is the culprit, I believe. Because, after disabling the store, the installing of apps on their own had stopped. This is really a nuisance and realme should never make it so hard for us to remove unwanted apps. Giving ads is one thing, but this is outright attacking people with ads, which is not at all a pleasant experience. There are some app groups called hot games and hot apps which are stupid and came back even after I disabled them twice. Eventually I was able to remove them for good. Only one tip for you- disable and remove network access for the realme app store and you can hopefully uninstall unwanted apps. There were no native keyboard applications (like Xiaomi), thankfully.Verdict- a good option for people with limited budget and needs. There is nothing amazing (except for battery life), but the phone is perfectly usable and fast enough to not being called a slow phone. The UI has good features but infected with ads. I believe premium offerings of realme don't have this problem. Not for people who love ad-free stock Android experience. But gets the job done with little money. Better than the lower budjet (6k-8k) phones. I will give 3.7 out of 5.",4.0 out of 5 stars
7642,"TOP GOOD THINGS I LIKE1) Phone is designed well for this price segment. Even though it is plastic we feel little premium.2) User interface is also much better. I love the way icons are designed. A good job done by realme UI 4.03) Some special features like dual audio, mini caplsule, sleep capsule add uniqueness to this phone.TOP BAD THINGS I HATE:1) Most review said Camera is average but for me I am putting camera performance in below average position. Especially front camera is not worth for this price segment too.2) Display is average. Previously also I used same IPS LCD display but while comparing, this display is poor.3) Performace is little slower. Even I don't have large size apps like gaming apps. Using basic apps itself slower in this phone.BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD:1) Price - I am not sure about this price is okay or not for this phone. But somewhat I feel okay.2) Speaker - Many phone under this price give dual speaker now-a-days but here it is provided with single speaker at the bottom. It's okay really sounds good. But my problem is the special feature ""200% volume"" is total waste. You can hear only noise not a quality sound. It is purely a gimmick.3) Battery - As I told already, I just have basic app not a single games app. Battery is average. But recharge fastly.CONCLUSION:1) If you are new to smart phone. This phone is okay for you.2) If you expecting a best phone in this price segment. Please refer some other phones, compare and decide. If you need good camera phone don't buy this. If you need good display phone compare other phone in this price segment.3) If you need a good realme UI experience in this price segment just order and get yours.",3.0 out of 5 stars
7643,"I recently got my hands on the Realme N55, and while it has some notable features, it's not without its downsides.**Pros:**1. **Decent Performance:** The phone's performance is okay for everyday tasks and light gaming. It handles most apps without much trouble, but don't expect it to be a powerhouse for heavy tasks.2. **Good Display:** The display is bright and colorful, making it enjoyable for watching videos and browsing content.3. **Camera Quality:** The camera does a decent job in well-lit conditions, capturing reasonably detailed photos. The AI enhancements can be hit or miss, but it's fine for casual photography.4. **Battery Life:** The battery life is satisfactory, getting me through a full day with moderate use.**Cons:**1. **Build Quality:** While the design looks premium, the build quality is not up to par. The plastic back feels a bit cheap and is prone to scratches.2. **Performance under Load:** The phone struggles with demanding tasks and heavy multitasking. It tends to slow down and lag, which can be frustrating.3. **Low-light Camera:** The camera performance takes a hit in low-light conditions. The images lack detail and can be quite grainy.4. **Bloatware:** The device comes preloaded with a fair amount of bloatware, which can't be easily removed. It's annoying to have apps you don't need taking up space and resources.5. **Software Updates:** The software updates are inconsistent, and sometimes it takes a while to receive the latest Android version or security patches.**Conclusion:**The Realme N55 is an affordable option with some good aspects, but it's not without its flaws. It's suitable for casual users who don't need a lot of processing power or are on a tight budget. However, if you're looking for a more robust and reliable smartphone, you might want to explore other options in the market. Keep your expectations in check, and you'll find the Realme N55 to be a decent entry-level device.",4.0 out of 5 stars
7644,"I recently purchased the Realme Narzo N55 in the Prime Black variant with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. While it has some impressive features, I have mixed feelings about this smartphone.Pros:1. **Super Fast Charging:** The 33W fast charging is a game-changer. It charges the phone rapidly, and I never have to worry about running out of battery during the day.2. **Stunning Camera:** The 64MP primary AI camera does deliver high-resolution photos with good clarity and color reproduction. It's a great choice for photography enthusiasts.3. **Ample Storage:** With 128GB of internal storage, I have plenty of space for all my apps, photos, and videos. No need to constantly delete files to make room.Cons:1. **Software Issues:** The phone occasionally suffers from software glitches. It freezes and lags at times, which can be frustrating. I hope Realme releases updates to address these issues.2. **Average Display:** The display is decent, but not exceptional. Colors are somewhat muted, and outdoor visibility could be better. It falls short compared to some competitors in this price range.3. **Build Quality:** While the phone feels sturdy, it's a bit on the bulky side. It's not the most comfortable phone to hold for extended periods, and the design could be more ergonomic.4. **Bloatware:** Realme preloads quite a bit of bloatware on the device. It takes up storage space and clutters the interface. Some of these apps cannot be uninstalled.Overall, the Realme Narzo N55 has its strengths, particularly in terms of fast charging and camera performance. However, it also has its fair share of shortcomings, including software issues and build quality. Whether it's the right phone for you depends on your priorities. If you value camera quality and fast charging, it might be worth considering. However, if you prioritize a smooth, hassle-free experience, you might want to explore other options in this price range.",3.0 out of 5 stars

My old Realme phone only single band gives full 30 at the same spot. But overall it is still value for money for hard pressed oldies like me.

7723,"Here is my honest review of the Redmi 12C smartphone:Pros:Good performance - The MediaTek Helio G85 processor and 4GB RAM provide smooth performance for day-to-day tasks and light gaming.Large display - It has a 6.71-inch HD+ display which is nice for watching videos and gaming. The teardrop notch is unobtrusive.Excellent battery life - With a large 5000mAh battery, the 12C can easily last 1.5-2 days of use on a single charge. Standby time is fantastic.Decent cameras - The 13MP rear and 5MP front cameras capture decent shots in good lighting conditions. The AI camera features are nice to have.Affordable price - Starting at just Rs. 8,999, the 12C offers good value considering the large display, battery and performance.Cons:Dated design - The thick bezels and plastic body make it look outdated compared to competitors. Build quality could be better.Average low-light photography - The cameras struggle in low light situations with visible noise. No ultra-wide or macro lens.Only 18W charging - Charging the large 5000mAh battery is slow with the included 18W charger. No support for faster charging.HD display - The display has only HD+ resolution (1600 x 720 pixels) resulting in less sharpness compared to Full HD displays.Overall, the Redmi 12C is a decent affordable smartphone for basic use and light gaming. It excels in battery life but has an outdated design and average camera performance. For the price, it's a good option for budget buyers who prioritize battery life and core performance. But those wanting better design or cameras can consider other options.",3.0 out of 5 stars
7724,"Camera does have 50 megapixel but you will get only portrait, normal, night, HDR and time lapse modes. I think night mode can be better.It is quite easy to use and is quite a sturdy one.It doesn't heat much but it can if you play high quality games which requires more functions like PUBG.Charging comes with normal one, there is no c type port and it takes its time to charge, no supercharge function.Appearance wise it's one of the best, you get great colour options and purple looks really good.I think this is a good budget phone.",4.0 out of 5 stars
7725,"Good built quality and appearance.Dislikes -many basic features that are only software related are also dropped for no reason.No new control center.Camera app don't have panorama, slow motion, document, AI modes. They are all software related not hardware which doesn't cost anything.Same way gallery editor is restricted of many common features like auto adjust image, colour focus filters etc.Auto brightness has some difficulty in adjustment.No live wallpaper,no always on display.Home screen grid is limited to only 4x4 and 5x5 in such a big screen. It should be atleast upto 5X7 option.No option to pin window or floating window, or split screen app option from recent menu.Hardware side -IR blaster, gyroscope sensor for compass, proximity sensor are missing for cost cutting.Type C charging port also dropped which is unbelievable.Extreme thick bazels and big lower space is just increased the size of phone.The weight is more than expected and size is also very big (even bigger than my redmi note 10 pro). God knows the reason behind making such bulky oversize phones. You cannot find any smaller size phone in the market.Screen quality, sound quality, camera quality are acceptable at this price range. No issue faced.Fingerprint sensor is at very high position, difficult to reach, and frequently you will touch camera lens instead of FP sensor because of the placement.Conclusion:On overall, it's basically a good hardware side purchase at this price range with very basic features (especially for elders and family members.

7727,"I recently had the chance to explore the Redmi 12C in Matte Black, and my experience has been a combination of both positive and not-so-positive aspects. Here's a detailed breakdown:Pros:High-Performance Processor: The inclusion of the Mediatek Helio G85 processor brings a noticeable boost in performance, ensuring smoother multitasking and responsiveness.Excellent Battery Life: The battery life on the Redmi 12C is certainly a standout feature. It holds up impressively even during extended use, reducing the need for frequent charges.Cons:Display Performance: While the display is good overall, it falls short of being exceptional. Colors and clarity are satisfactory, but I expected a bit more vibrancy and sharpness.Sound Quality: Unfortunately, the sound quality did not meet my expectations. The audio output lacks the depth and richness I anticipated, which can impact the overall multimedia experience.MIUI OS: The MIUI operating system brings its own set of challenges. The user experience could be smoother, and certain functionalities, such as the contact search not showing recently added contacts and a delay in recent call history list updates, have been noticeable issues.Camera Performance: The camera's performance is average, offering acceptable results but not quite meeting the high standards set by other devices in this category.The Redmi 12C brings a mix of features to the table, with some aspects that shine and others that leave room for improvement. The high-performance processor and remarkable battery life are commendable, providing an enhanced user experience. However, areas like display vibrancy, sound quality, and the MIUI OS experience could use further refinement. While the camera captures moments adequately, it doesn't deliver exceptional results.

7840,A very good budget smartphone for my mom.New user of smartphone.Does all job for normal use.,4.0 out of 5 stars
7841,"I have purchased this phone for my mother, this is her first smart phone so i thought i should go for a simple smartphone with clean ui with a large battery. So bought this. Now let's talk about the pros and consPros:1. Large screen: the screen is really big and colours are bright.2. Large battery: 5000 mah battery is really useful, my mother doesn't use the phone too much so it's last for 2 to 3 days with minimal usage.3. Android go : it has the Android 13 go edition so it's light version that's why it's working smooth.4. Dual rear camera does it's job but the front camera is really impressive.5.Dialer: It has Xiaomi dialer so you can record call without announcement.Cons :1. No type C port so we have to carry an extra cable as all of our phone has type C port.2. Long Charging time: no fast charging provided so it's taking longer time to charge the battery.3. No widget options ( till now August 2023) so you can't add weather or clock or contact widget on the home screen.4. No double tap to screen on/off feature ( till now Aug 2023).5. It's taking time to load videos or the settings options on 2gb variant, i mean if i open YouTube it's taking 4 to 5 second to load the videos on YouTube ( I'm using the device on WiFi so no network issue, it's happening for the weak processor). I have installed WhatsApp from play store, nothing else installed on the phone but still it's taking some times for some app loading. But it's okay it's not a issue for someone who just started using smartphone.Also you can uninstall or disable maximum of preloaded apps. I have uninstalled maximum of those apps. Also I have disabled the Chrome browser, as my mother didn't search any thing on internet. I have disabled the browser so even if my mother clicked on any link on YouTube or on another apps it doesn't work so kind of safe for my mother also.So i just want to say this phone is just for calling, WhatsApp, for normal YouTube videos & music. Also i think if you are getting the 2GB variant under 6k then it's a good deal. Don't pay more for this even if you are buying 4gb 64gb it will not change much on the performance.Thank you.Edit 1 : Even after getting 3 software updates they didn't include the widgets option as well as the double tap function. So i think this option will not available in future also, may be this features are not for Android go editions. So keep that in mind, although my mother never complaint about the clok as she check the time from the notification bar or from the lock screen.",4.0 out of 5 stars

7843,"After using it for a month, I can state , the Redmi A2 (Classic Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) is an excellent budget smartphone that delivers impressive features and performance. From its vibrant display to its capable cameras and long-lasting battery, it offers a well-rounded experience for the price. If you are looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone, I highly recommend considering the Redmi A2.Pros:1. Great value for money: The Redmi A2 offers an impressive range of features and performance at an affordable price point.2. Vibrant display: The 6.52-inch IPS LCD screen delivers sharp and clear visuals, making it enjoyable for multimedia consumption.3. Smooth performance: The Mediatek Helio G36 chipset, coupled with the octa-core processor and 4GB RAM, ensures smooth multitasking and lag-free performance.4. Expandable storage: The device comes with 64GB of internal storage, which can be further expanded using the dedicated microSDXC card slot, providing ample space for your files and apps.5. Decent camera performance: The dual rear cameras capture satisfactory photos with good detail and color accuracy, and the addition of features like dual-LED flash and HDR enhances the camera's capabilities.6. Long-lasting battery: The 5000mAh non-removable battery offers excellent battery life, allowing for a full day of usage without worrying about running out of power.7. User-friendly interface: The Redmi A2 runs on Android 13 (Go edition) with MIUI, providing a user-friendly interface and a range of customization options.8. Sleek design: The device boasts a sleek and slim design, with the Classic Black color variant adding an elegant touch.9. Added benefit is warranty - 2 years [1 year + extra 1 year (special introductory offer)]Cons:1. Moderate display resolution: While the display is vibrant, the 720 x 1600 pixel resolution may not offer the highest level of sharpness compared to higher-end devices.2. Modest camera setup: The camera setup on the Redmi A2 is modest, which may not satisfy users who require advanced camera capabilities.3. Limited charging speed: The device supports 10W wired charging, which is not as fast as some other smartphones in the market.Please be aware that these benefits and drawbacks are based on individual usage and may change based on preferences and usage patterns.",4.0 out of 5 stars
7844,"Nice mobile in this price range I get it for only 5.4k it's an good price1 camera: camera 📸 quality is very nice for camera 5/52 gaming : in this price range it comes with an good processor no lag on small games like temple run , Subway surfers ect 4/53 display: the display quality is also good at this price range 4/54 battery: battery will last upto more than 8 hrs on simple use like browsing , YouTube,calls ,camera 4/55 charging time: it comes with 10w changer it takes more than 4 hrs to Full change 4/5Overall score is 4/5",4.0 out of 5 stars
7845,Met the expectations,4.0 out of 5 stars
7846,"Before saying anything about A2, I would like to mention properly that is a below ₹7,000 smartphone. In this slab of pricing, Xiaomi has packed a USB charger, decent battery which goes on from 13-15 hours in good use (non gaming, movie etc) in single charge.Camera is good, not exceptional.The OS feels like Stock Android. As Classic MIUI Apps seemed missing by me like notes, compass, IR Remote.Does not support 5GHz Wifi. Works smooth on 2.4Ghz Wifi.The built qualify is simply AWESOME. Feel in hand is Awesome.Brithness is pretty good, touch and response time is very smooth and fast. Bootup time is pretty fast too.Comes with a dedicated SD Card slot along with dual sim slots (total 3 slots in tray).In box they have packed the phone, charger, USB type A-B cable. (No tempered glass or back cover), No fingerprint or face unlock - REMEMBER THE PRICE.Final conclusion: the phone is good in this price range specially the smoothness, built quality, screen size, clean Android OS with majority Google's Apps like Google One, Google Gallery etc. Yes some small small things are missing but that is fine because the price is also kept pretty low. The Phone is good for those who have average use of smartphones or if you want to make this as a secondary business need smartphone. Or simply a phone for a school student.I recommend this product untill and unless Redmi asks you to pay more than ₹7500.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Redmi has truly impressed me with the durability and reliability of this device. The battery life is exceptional, lasting through a full day with regular use without any hassle.What I appreciate the most is that Redmi has managed to offer a great product at a very reasonable price. For those who prioritize functionality and reliability over flashy features, this brand is an excellent option. The simplicity and user-friendly interface make it perfect for older individuals who mainly use their phone for calls.The build quality is sturdy, and the design is elegant. Redmi has certainly crafted a product that balances performance, affordability, and longevity.In summary, the Redmi 9 Activ Mobile is a fantastic choice for individuals seeking a dependable phone primarily for calls and essential communication.

8101,"I would like to rate 4/5 . I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantage I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.My requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )2) Rear Camera is More than enough (50 Mp No shake (OIS) Camera ll give the performance as Sony camera mobile. (Good for both day night photography)(Front camera is not upto the mark)3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.Cons :-1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic . AverageOne more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile camera4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .No more cons I found till date. I ll update later.Suggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.If your priorities is display , camera and battery you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates.Thank you...❤️",4.0 out of 5 stars
8102,"👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performanceFront and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average 😆 but manageable if you have back cover.Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.I couldn't find a phone which has:Super AmoLed Bright display.6000 mAh battery.OIS camera.120hz Refresh Rate.4 years of OS (stock Android like) updatesDecent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)5G with several bands.It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,",4.0 out of 5 stars
8103,"I choose this phone after checking many below 20-25K priced phone, one main feature I wanted this time was to migrate and ditch chinese phones.It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.Overall a nice deal !",4.0 out of 5 stars

8106,"Reason behind to choose samsung phones is the display and the camera which is always be at par with other brands ..... As per the price and the brands it's never dissapoint you.only cons is the u dope notch.and the charger is not in the box. Else everything is perfect 6000mh massive battery and super amoled display 120hz refresh rate, tested Exynos 1280 SoC,chipset which offers you major 4 updates ,if you are heavy gamer,then these will not for you. For normal gamming it's been quite study .camera is upto the mark.with ..And moreover it's a made in India product..not such typical chines phones.....connectivity and performance of 5g bands are decent. Exynos 1280 SoC, chipset for havy tasking might get heating issue..Hopefully upcoming updates may resolved such issues...otherwise it's a capable processor.",4.0 out of 5 stars

8108,"Got the phone at 15k with charger, why you should buy it ???1/camera - best camera under this price range with ois support, no brand is offering this at this price range. Also what sets apart samsung from other chinese brands is that it does not whiten you face 😂😂.....speaking from a persceptive of real me 8 user.2/ ui - best ui with unique features like knox security, samsung pay , object eraser, nfc which no brand offers. It got the best in class customization & ui experience. It will get 4 major android update too which is also the best.3/ performance - in this case the processor is not that good there are some lags in the ui maybe it will solve after updates. As of 1st Aug it did not get any updates. 120hz feels very smooth too.4/ battery - with 25 w charger it can be charged upto 85 to 90 % under 50 min from 30% which is decent. 85% with basic usage will last a day easily.5/ speakers - they are not stereo speakers but it has very good bass and treble. Also the output of eraphones is very good.So if you are looking for a phone which has a very powerful processor with losts of bloatware which can charge within 10 min then this is not the one for you. If you want a best camera phone with great ui experience, good battery life, decent performance, moderately fast charging phone then this is the perfect phone for you.Previously I have used lumia , Micromax, zenphone, real me8 . I can definitely say this ia the best phone that I have used so far. I will not be able to switch to any other chinese brands after the experience of one ui.",4.0 out of 5 stars
8109,"I have some mixed reviews about this phone.1. I love the camera. It's quite amazing. You can see some snapshots.2. Battery is awesome.3. Display is quite good. But here I have something to tell you guys. After purchasing, 8days later somehow my phone dropped from my bed. With back cover and tempered glass.. But the fluid comes out and you can see what happens with my display in the last uploaded pic. Samsung says it won't comes under any warranty. So, I have to spend 6k for display change.I've got this phone 15k arround.So, apart from what happened to me, I am quite happy with this phone. If u r buying this, please order cover and screen protector first.Review after 20days-My phone dropped from my bed with back cover and tempered glass. Display damaged. Samsung service center says they won't cover warrenty of this display. So I ordered the display paying 6k rs on 27th July. Today is 6 August, they said to me that in whole India they don't have a single unit display of this phone, so probably they arranged it from UK.

8110,"This phone is not a:* Gaming phone* High performance phonePerforms day to day tasks with ease and may be basic gaming.Call quality is decent.What is Good:* Amoled display* Dolby Atmos* HIGHLY OPTIMISED phone - so battery lasts longer not just because of bigger battery.* 6000 Mah battery - Depending upon usage, it can easily last 1.5 day and upto 2 days* Decent camera* Few bloatware* 4yrs OS update and 5 yrs security update (but not sure if the phone can handle 3rd or the 4th OS update)* Screen brightess is Good and viewable under direct sunlight.* No in screen finger print scanner - Meaning if for some reason you have to replace the screen, it will be slightly less expensive. Amoled screens with fingerprint scanner will cost you half your phones priceWhat to expect:* From time to time you may notice slowness/lag - If you have too many apps installed* Not intended for high memory utilizing apps* Slight Heating issues from time to time* Slow charging if you don't use Samsung fast charger. Tried 33W fast charger - charging is still slow.* May not be able to handle Android OS 15 or later updates* Videos can be viewed at maximum resolution of 1080P. Does not support 1220p or 1440P.* Has only single stereo speaker* It's better not to charge the phone when it's hot, charging will be slow even with Samsung charger.Note: It's an old chipset known for heating issues. The same chipset was used in Samsung M33. The only reason it works well, is because the OS is highly optimised.The phone is for those users:a) Who performs basic to medium tasks/activities.b) Stable phone with regular OS updates and security patchesc) Intends to use the phone for 3+yrsIf you do decide to buy this phone, I would recommend you to go with 8GB ram else go for something else.Alternate phones - Infinix GT 10",3.0 out of 5 stars
8111,"I will keep it really brief because there a lot of reviews explaining everything and a ton of youtube videos. In short words, the product is amazing. The things which are really good are Camera, mainly 50MP and the front cam; Display, battery backup and Samsung UI.The major disappointment is the unavailability of charger in the box, which is actually a deal breaker for many because there are a lot of phones in this price providing the same. Another thing is the absence of even basic screen guard and back cover. Now all the rival brands are providing and this being a new launch, its impossible to find the right tempered glass and back cover for atleast 3 months. The gorilla glass is not much to rely on as I had a scratch just by putting in pocket. Inspite of all this I still went for this because of a really good exchange deal from Amazon.",4.0 out of 5 stars

8120,"Was using g a M30 which is a great phone for the price point. (Going great even after 4 years..)M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gbM30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not requiredJio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..5g is perceptibly fast..Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank cardOverall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile",5.0 out of 5 stars

Since then it has been a good experience with samsung. They have a proper customer service base which is really reliable, thus I chose M34 for my mom.This M34 runs at 120hz always where as my s22+ runs on adaptive mode, so the M34 feels smoother on hand than s22+.It looks stunning, UI is fluid, sound is loud, network reception okay, haptic feedback is nice, battery life is more than 2 days while it latches on a Wi-Fi network.Got it for around 8k.

I bought a back-cover for the phone and now the fingerprint scanner is totally covered by the back cover. I am facing extreme difficulty in logging in to my secure apps and office apps.(2) The sim tray can accommodate either 2 sim cards, or 1 sim card and 1 memory card.

8181,"It's been 7 days since I started using it. In this 1 week my experience with Lava Blaze 5G was more bad than good. Although it wasn't worse as some might think. So, let's start the review from where it needs to be.Delivery and Unboxing- The package I received was really the worst in my entire life. There was only the amazon cardboard box but that's it. It was very wore out, loose and completely opened from one side. On top of that there was no foam, bubble wrap or thermocol sheet at all to protect from accidental shocks or any damage. At first impression it felt like my package has been tampered but thankfully that's not the case. I would request amazon to improve their packaging and I would like to ask about why their packaging quality got degraded over the years. I didn't pay 12k rupees to just receive whatever garbage you can give me. It was an entire months hard earned money. When I started unboxing it everything was there safe and sound. Now I took a sigh of relief. What made me more happy was after setting up the phone I saw the battery was 56%. Every phone I bought till now used to have 49% or below. This is the first ever phone that gives 56% out of the box. Even more exciting thing was this phone gives clean Android with no bloatware and limited features too. But let me inform you that this is not Stock Android. It just uses Google apps and doesn't have any mp3 player, video player or even a gallery of it's own. I wonder if they really have to give only Google apps then they could've provided Google Gallery. Also Lava is using a custom skin but it was hidden so brilliantly that you can't find it even if you wanted to. The customization features of Blaze 5G proved that.Battery and Charging- 2nd thing about this phone that impressed me. After unboxing it I charged it upto 79% only and did normal tasks like watching Amazon prime, using Google, phone calls, SMS, WhatsApp etc and after 43 hours and 31 minute the battery was 14%. I really was shocked to see this. Imagine how much time it would take to fully deplete the battery. Also, what could've happened if I charged the phone to 100%. But let me tell you it's not because of the enormous 5000mAh battery. This great backup is only because of Lava using Mediatek Dimensity 700 and how well they optimised the battery. Also the clean Android plays a huge role too as there are no apps that will suck the battery in background. Additionally, the 720x1600p display is also another reason for it as it will do less processing compared to a Full HD+ display. That's why it will consume less power. But in gaming I will say it's same as any other phone. Battery will deplete faster and it also depends on what games you play. They give you a 12W charger in the box but the Lava Customer Care confirmed me that Blaze 5G supports upto 15W charging. So if you already have a 15W charger in home you can easily fast charge it. The 12W charger takes more than 3 hours for charging 0 to 100%. Using a 15W charger will make it a bit faster. Expect upto 2 hours for fully charging with a 15W charger.Display- This phone has a 6.52 inch, 720x1600 (HD+) 90Hz IPS LCD panel, 20:9 aspect ratio with ~269ppi. But don't be disappointed by hearing the resolution numbers. I had seen IRL it feels same as any 1080p display. There is no pixelation, no sluggish-ness and picture quality is great. 90Hz refresh rate makes the phone feel very fast too. Also, the display is very clear in direct sunlight outside. In general the phone is somehow having more nits than anyone else. Just decrease your brightness to the lowest and you'll see that Blaze 5G is still bright than other phones of any price you say. Now this was oddly satisfying to me.CPU and Performance- This phone uses a Mediatek Dimensity 700, 6GB RAM and Mali-G57 MC2 GPU. I has been gaming on this phone since the day I received it and it really impressed me in gaming. I play Eversoul, Brawl Stars, T3 Arena, Asphalt 9, The 7 Deadly Sins Grand Cross, Sword Art Online: Integral Factor and Tasokare Hotel. Eversoul, Asphalt 9 and T3 Arena are actually heavy games and will make your phone heat in no time. They do lag on budget phones and perform badly. But playing these games on Blaze 5G was wonderful. They run really very smooth and have no lags, jitters or any frame drops at all and I play entire day but the temps of this phone never reached 40°. It reached maximum 36°-37° till now. I really loved how Lava worked on the thermals and it doesn't warm at all and always stays at room temps. Let me tell you that just opening Eversoul makes my Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G overheat like crazy. It takes only 1-2 minute to get 58.9°. Yes, I switched to Lava Blaze 5G from a 37k S20 FE 5G and that too because of overheating, thermal throttling and even though S20 FE 5G is equipped with a Snapdragon 865 but it still lags while gaming. Some games has started crashing recently too on it. Thankfully Blaze 5G doesn't have any issues and is very stable. I really loved Blaze 5G giving the option of virtual memory too. But let me tell you that virtual memory is only useful for devices under 4GB of RAM. It won't be any helpful for 6GB and above RAM so I had disabled it after first boot. On top of that you will lose a chunk of your storage unnecessarily. I will suggest everyone to use your Blaze 5G with virtual memory disabled. The memory management in this phone has been another impressive thing. If you minimize the apps or games and open it after 30 minutes, it will resume from where you left and didn't reload. Where my more expensive S20 FE 5G sometimes reloads the apps and games.Audio- This phone gave me mixed feelings in the matter of audio. Playing music with YT music will feel something else, playing music with Google Files will make you feel something else and facebook, WhatsApp or YouTube will give another kind of feeling. Sometimes it can sound hollow, sometimes it will sound suppress but sometimes it will sound great. It depends on what app you're using and if the music is a mp3 file or you're streaming online. The presence of 3.5mm jack was really impressive too. You can use Bluetooth Neckband, TWS earbuds, 3.5mm earphones and Type-C earphones. I have used pTron Bassbuds Duo, KDM A-2 neckband and Core Type-C earphones. It support it all. A really great thing that you can't get in 200k 300k rupees phone. I really enjoyed the multi support for audio. Otherwise the lack of 3.5mm jack is becoming very normal in budget phones too.Camera- The photos and videos are exactly what made me hate this phone. This phone comes with Triple Camera AI Setup. Primary one is 50 Megapixels, 2nd module is a 2 Megapixels Macro and 3rd one is not mentioned anywhere but when I asked the Lava Customer Care they told me it is a 0.2 Megapixel VGA module. There is no depth sensor or telephoto lens. A lot of people will dislike this setup but it was good for me as I don't use the telephoto very often. Both the photos and videos are very bad. Sharpness is what a budget phone will give you but there is no HDR, perfect white balance, and while shooting in broad daylight it will overexpose everything. It extremely overexposed my indoor lighting too and I use only 1 CFL bulb for each room. Take this statement as a fact that this camera module will overexpose even a single photon. Let alone broad daylight situation. The colors will be a bit washed out too. I took a photo of my Hero Sprint cycle which is red color but the photo was showing light red/orange-ish color. Software updates of Lava is like non-existent so no idea when we will receive one but these canera issues can be fixed by a software upgrade for sure. But let me tell you that even though Lava advertised Blaze 5G can shoot 2K EIS but that's not the exact matter. You can use EIS in 480p recording too. I have done that and I still don't know if it's a bug or feature but I had shot footages of 480p non-eis, 480p eis, 720p non-eis, 720p eis, 1080p non-eis, 1080p eis, 1440p non-eis and 1440p eis. Glad they didn't lock the EIS function to only 2K. I have attached all the photos so you can take a good look at how both the front and rear camera perform at day and night.Connectivity- Again it impressed me and this time it was in the matter of connectivity. I have used both of my airtel 5G SIM AND THIS PHONE RUNS DUAL 5G 🤩🤩🤩 I was able to use mobile data from both of these SIM cards and I was getting the expected 5G speed. It also runs dual 4G and dual 3G too. Something that even the extremely high priced phones like Samsung S23 Ultra and iPhone 14 series and 15 series don't provide at all but this Lava 5G did it and it really performs flawlessly. WiFi didn't have any disconnection issues at all and the Bluetooth was able to transfer 4GB of data a little bit faster which I never expected. Lava has played some serious games here with the dual 5G and such capable Bluetooth module. Hotspot didn't face any issues too. Sharing files over both hotspot and Nearby Share was flawlessly fast. Kudos to Lava for providing a connectivity that challenges phones (not so) worth of lakhs.Final Verdict- So... Should you buy this phone or not? I will say yes and will recommend it but it also depends from person to person. It was very depressing to see that they don't have any service center in Bhubaneswar, Odisha too. Thankfully they compensated this by providing home service so an agent of their will come to your home and will fix everything but if something serious is found, then they'll take the device to service center. Overall this device outstands everything and I have seen a test where Blaze 5G beats S22 Ultra in 5G speed test. So undoubtedly a great device but it is having a huge headroom for improvements.Thank you and have a nice day 😊",4.0 out of 5 stars
8182,"PROS- 5G full speed, no overheating, good battery life, clean UI, no ads. Recommended for parents or older people.CONS- Camera is average, Bugs are there, Build quality is average, Not for gaming.Camera: There is a bug with Android 13, the camera is taking pictures by itself, else than that camera is like a 10k phone. So nothing good but photos look 50 megapixel. It is good enough. In artificial and low light you might need to fix things a bit but it's good.Display: This is unusual but this phone has really good display. It's IPS LCD but the quality is like a 15k phone, so it's pretty decent. Watching content is the most I use in this phone.Also 90hz display soothes the eye.Charging & Battery Life: charging is slow but worth it. Battery life is good. Like this will last for 1 day atleast if you don't play games.Gaming- THIS PHONE IS NOT FOR GAMING(LIKE BGMI, CODM) . Small games work flawlessly.THE UI: ONE OF THE BEST REASONS TO RECOMMEND THIS TO PARENTS BECAUSE THE UI IS OPTIMISED TO FEEL THAT ITS MADE FOR AN OLD PERSON, LIKE LITERALLY SOMEONE MADE THE ICONS BIG BY DEFAULT.( this is a very good thing because you don't have to toggle too much)Bugs: YES THERE ARE BUGS IN THIS PHONE, BUT IS IT NOT USABLE? NO, I DON'T FEEL BUGS AFFECT THAT MUCH.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Pros a mobile needs to be presenablle and comfort to hold and work without much of fuss.On this count it is a PASS.Now what surprise me that a Android 13 upgrade was on the card.this thrilled me immensely as Lava was silent on this aspect.A minimum of 2-3 upgrades on Android are a must.Processor I also working well. 5G Speed was at par with other mobiles in this price bracket.Infact this is the cheapest 5Gvset which is holding its Head high. looks are average.In Cons battery charge is slow which if provided with a fast Charging would have enhanced it's utility.All future mobiles without this enhanced utility would have been most welcome.My comments are keeping with its price bracket.All in all I am at peace with this buy Well done LAVA,you have done it",4.0 out of 5 stars

Very slow charger.,3.0 out of 5 stars
8192,"Pros:Sleek Design: The Glass Blue colour is gorgeous and gives the phone a premium look and feel. It's a head-turner for sure.Smooth Performance: With 8GB of RAM and the snappy UFS 2.2 storage, this phone handles multitasking with ease. Apps load quickly, and there's no noticeable lag in daily usage.5G Connectivity: Being 5G-ready is a big plus, ensuring that I'm future-proofed for faster data speeds as 5G networks become more widespread.Impressive Camera: The 50MP AI triple camera setup delivers stunning photos. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the shots, especially in well-lit conditions. The AI enhancements add a nice touch to photos.Expandable RAM: The option to expand the RAM up to 16GB is a unique feature that ensures the phone's longevity in terms of performance.Clean Android: No bloatware is a blessing. The phone runs on a clean Android interface, which not only feels snappier but also offers a clutter-free experience.Included Charger: It's always great when a charger is included in the box. It saves the hassle of buying one separately.Cons:Software Updates: Although the phone runs on a clean Android interface, the frequency and longevity of software updates can be a concern. Regular updates are crucial for security and performance improvements.Camera in Low Light: While the camera performs well in well-lit conditions, it struggles in low-light environments. The photos tend to have noise and lack detail in such scenarios.Not for Gamers: While the phone handles day-to-day tasks well, it may not be the best choice for hardcore gamers due to its mid-range chipset.",5.0 out of 5 stars

No bloatware and stock android6. And finally, Good battery with day day performance as my wife don't play game.I am truly happy to share that this phone has exceeded my expectations in every corner. Actually, I was little skeptical about the screen as it is only HD plus, however to my surprise, it is best HD plus display I have every seen. Not much difference. Camera also exceeded my expectations, though little improvement is required in white exposure. And surprisingly, it is from indian brand Lava. Long live Lava!! Keep doing great. I am owing samsung but I swear If Lava keeps doing this, my next phone will be from Lava. Everyone in my family and friends praised this. My true words.Few things which was a true surprise as I didn't expect at all in this price segment:-1. Haptics (best means best, even better than premium segment phones)2. Screen color reproduction is sometimes equal to that of Amoled, though not always. But believe me HD plus display will not be a regret.3. awesome Ram management and UFC 2.1 will definitely make your feel of using a premium phones4. Looks - not even 25 to 30k phone will come near to this.Though, some cons are also there-1. Slow charger - takes around 3 hours to charge battery, though battery backup is Superb.2. Video lags in 2k 60 FPS, though work fine in 1080 60 fps. This really requires efforts from Lava as it is possible to improve via update.3. Camera white exposure and portrait mode requires improvements.4. Background stream - in review videos, option of background stream like YouTube is shown, however in reality, I am unable to see this. Please get this done with an update.5. Last but not least - place of fingerprint sensor or power key sometimes feel uncomfortable for new user. Though, not an issue after some days use.If the above issues are possible to resolve, please resolve Lava.No phone can come close to this pure stock android experience in this price range.However, the way you have made a come back in indian market is Superb.

However, one can use pro mode to adjust exposure to some extent. At times for some modes, you may see pixelation. The macro shots taken in Sunlight are highly exposed. The long shots in day and night are good. Video has EIS, Slow motion and Time Lapse and screen recording options. Music Sound, Call quality and call recording is decent. Display is overall good. Almost pure android 12. I could test Airtel 5G and Reliance Jio 5G on this phone and I got speed upto 300 mbps on Airtel 5G and 500 mbps speed on Reliance Jio 5G. So, the phone is 5G ready out of the box. Duel port charger is provided.Further improvements expected:-Need wireless FM.-Need camera tunning to adjust exposure to Sun light in all modes-Need more PPI.-Side buttons and senser position and button length is a little problem when attaching phone on the Tripod.-Double tap screen wake up / off missing- Need more gesture control options-Key board sensitivity is inconsistent for some applications and in web-based form fill in-Application like BHIM loads bit slower-Need Gorilla glass.Overall, very good efforts by an Indian company ""Lava"".

Inspite of being prime member, still there was a delay in delivery and took three days, poor Amazon customer services, the same repeated standard reverts to everyone, no empathy, sympathy and special treatment to prime members also for early delivery, Amazon is cheating the customers inviting to become prime members, not acceptable from Amazon.

8305,"The Samsung M04 offers a budget-friendly option with a 6.2-inch display, providing a decent viewing experience for its price point. Its performance is satisfactory for everyday tasks thanks to the Snapdragon processor and 3GB of RAM, though demanding apps or games might not run as smoothly.The camera setup, featuring a dual-lens rear camera with a 13MP main sensor and a 2MP depth sensor, captures acceptable photos in well-lit conditions, but struggles in low light. The front-facing 5MP camera is suitable for basic selfies and video calls.The device houses a 5,000mAh battery, which can easily last through a day of regular usage. However, charging is done through a micro-USB port, which might be a bit outdated for some users.On the software side, the M04 runs Samsung's One UI on top of Android, providing a user-friendly experience and some customization options. As for storage, the 32GB internal storage can be expanded via microSD card for those who need more space.In summary, the Samsung M04 is a decent budget smartphone that gets the basics done, but it's important to manage expectations given its limitations in terms of performance and camera quality, which are common trade-offs in this price range.",4.0 out of 5 stars
8306,"The Samsung Galaxy M04 is an affordable smartphone that offers decent performance and good battery life . However, it lacks some features such as gyroscope sensitivity and a macro camera 📷.If you are looking for a budget-friendly phone that can handle basic tasks like calling, texting, and browsing the internet, the Samsung Galaxy M04 is a good choice. It has a large 6.5-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 720x1600 pixels . The phone is powered by a MediaTek Helio P35 processor and comes with 4GB of RAM . It runs on Android 12 and is powered by a 5000mAh battery🔋.The phone has a 13-megapixel primary camera on the rear and a 5-megapixel front camera for selfies . It also has a microSD card slot that allows you to expand the storage up to 1TB .🙂",4.0 out of 5 stars
8307,"The Samsung Galaxy M04 in Light Green may be budget-friendly, but it falls disappointingly short when it comes to camera performance. If you're someone who enjoys capturing life's moments with stunning clarity, this phone is bound to leave you feeling frustrated.Camera Performance:The 13MP primary camera on the Galaxy M04 struggles to produce satisfactory results, especially in anything less than optimal lighting conditions. Photos taken indoors or in low-light environments suffer from excessive noise and lack of detail. Even in well-lit settings, the colors appear muted, and the dynamic range is limited. The 5MP front camera is equally lackluster, producing selfies that lack sharpness and clarity. If you're a photography enthusiast, this phone simply won't meet your expectations.Gaming Performance:While the Galaxy M04 manages day-to-day tasks adequately, it's not designed for high-performance gaming. Graphically demanding games often suffer from lag and frame rate drops, making the gaming experience less enjoyable. If you're into heavy mobile gaming, you'd be better off considering a more powerful device.Battery Life:Although the 5,000mAh battery is impressive on paper, the subpar gaming performance drains the battery quickly during extended gaming sessions. While the phone may suffice for parents who use it for occasional tasks, the battery life may not last a full day under heavy usage scenarios.Display:The 6.3-inch HD+ LCD display is mediocre at best. While it gets the job done for casual media consumption, the lack of vibrant colors and average viewing angles fail to impress. The visual experience simply doesn't match up to other smartphones in this price range.Software and Updates:Samsung's One UI skin is generally user-friendly, but the budget nature of this phone means that major updates and feature enhancements might not be promptly delivered. This could lead to missing out on essential improvements and security patches.Conclusion:If you're a photography enthusiast or a heavy mobile gamer, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green will be a major disappointment. The lackluster camera performance, subpar gaming capabilities, and average display make it unsuitable for users who prioritize these aspects. However, if you're a parent or a casual user who primarily needs a phone for basic tasks like calls, messaging, and light browsing, the Galaxy M04 might suffice. For anything more demanding, there are better options available in the market at a similar price point.Pros:Suitable for parents or casual users with basic needsAffordable price pointCons:Subpar camera performance in various lighting conditionsNot suitable for high-performance gamingMediocre display qualityPotential delays in major software updatesRating: 2.5/5",3.0 out of 5 stars

8316,"I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy M04 in the eye-catching Light Green color variant, and I must say I am quite impressed with what this budget-friendly smartphone has to offer. At a price of just 7499, it delivers a compelling combination of features that cater to the needs of everyday users.Performance-wise, the Samsung Galaxy M04 is equipped with a MediaTek Helio P35 Octa-core processor, which handles day-to-day tasks and applications smoothly. The 4GB of RAM ensures multitasking is manageable, but what's interesting is the RAM Plus feature that allows users to utilize up to 8GB of RAM, providing extra headroom for demanding apps and games.With 64GB of onboard storage, there's ample space to store your favorite apps, photos, videos, and more. In case you need additional storage, the phone also supports expandable storage via a microSD card.The highlight of the Samsung Galaxy M04 is undoubtedly its long-lasting 5000mAh battery. For regular users, this battery capacity easily lasts a full day on a single charge, reducing the need to carry a charger around constantly. It's a relief to know that this phone won't leave you stranded with a dead battery when you need it the most.Moving on to the camera capabilities, the Galaxy M04 sports a 13MP dual-camera setup, which captures decent photos in good lighting conditions. While it might not produce the same quality images as high-end flagship devices, it certainly suffices for social media sharing and general photography needs. The camera app offers some useful features like portrait mode and various filters to enhance your photography experience.In terms of design, the Light Green color variant is refreshing and stands out from the usual black or white smartphones in the market. The phone's build quality feels solid, and the ergonomic design makes it comfortable to hold for extended periods.On the software front, the Samsung Galaxy M04 runs on the company's One UI, which is known for its user-friendly interface and customizability. With the latest Android version pre-installed, you can expect a smooth and familiar user experience.However, it's important to note that this phone might not be the best choice for heavy mobile gamers or those seeking cutting-edge performance, as it is more tailored for casual users with everyday needs.In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green edition is an excellent option for anyone looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone. With its striking design, impressive battery life, and the option to expand RAM, it offers great value for money at a price point of 7499. Whether you are a student, a professional, or someone who just needs a dependable device for day-to-day tasks, the Galaxy M04 won't disappoint.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Amazon has to provide a manual IMEI to the agent for verification or has to provide with a different solution as the old mobiles are listed in the Exchange list in Amazon App. The worst part is that the delivery agent is helpless and asking us to cancel the order as he dosent have a way forward.

Additionally, the device does not operate as swiftly as higher-end phones, as it is primarily designed for basic purposes. Expectations of exceptional speed should be tempered.

8425,"I recently purchased the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G and wanted to share my experience with this smartphone.In terms of specifications and features, this phone offers a lot for its price. The 5G capability is a great addition, providing faster data speeds and a smoother browsing experience. The overall performance is commendable, and it handles most applications and tasks with ease.However, I did encounter a camera issue after some usage. The camera app would show an error and close abruptly, which was frustrating. Initially, the customer service was not as helpful as I expected. They directed me to visit a service center, but unfortunately, these centers are not easily accessible in smaller towns. Fortunately, after a software update, the issue resolved itself, and the camera started functioning normally.Considering the price range, this smartphone competes well in the market. For users who primarily need a phone for calls and using light applications, this brand is worth considering. However, potential buyers should be aware of the possibility of encountering minor software glitches and limited accessibility to service centers in certain areas.In summary, the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G is a feature-rich smartphone with competitive specifications for its price. If you're a moderate user looking for a budget-friendly 5G-enabled phone, this is worth considering.",4.0 out of 5 stars
8426,"The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G has captured my attention with its blend of features, promising a solid performance in the 5G smartphone arena. Here's a comprehensive review of my experience with this device:Pros:Great Performance: The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G delivers on its promise of excellent performance, making multitasking, gaming, and app usage a smooth and seamless experience.Good Battery Life: With respectable battery endurance, the device keeps up with daily demands, ensuring you stay connected and entertained throughout the day.120Hz Display: The inclusion of a 120Hz display adds fluidity to interactions and enhances the visual experience, especially during gaming and scrolling.Reliable Camera Performance: The camera system of the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G proves dependable, capturing moments with clarity and accuracy.Premium Design: The device's design exudes a sense of premium craftsmanship, making it a stylish addition to your tech ensemble.Cons:Missing Charger in the Box: The absence of a charger in the package might be disappointing to users who expect a complete out-of-the-box experience.Minor Lag and Software Experience: While the device's performance is commendable, some users might notice minor lags across the UI, indicating room for software optimization to enhance the overall user experience.Lack of Night Mode in 4GB RAM Variant: Users of the 4GB RAM variant are left without the convenience of a night mode, potentially affecting low-light photography.Limited 5G Bands: The device supports only two 5G bands, which could limit its compatibility and usability in certain regions.Final Thoughts:The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G stands out for its notable strengths in performance, battery life, display quality, camera capabilities, and premium design. However, it's not without its shortcomings. The absence of a charger and the software experience's minor lags might be areas of concern for some users. Additionally, the lack of a night mode in the 4GB RAM variant and the limited 5G band support could impact certain user preferences and usage scenarios.In essence, the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G offers a commendable performance package, but its drawbacks should be considered in the context of your specific needs and priorities.",4.0 out of 5 stars

8450,"I recently purchased the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G in Stellar Green color, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The phone came with a travel adapter included in the box, which is a nice bonus. Let me share my experience with this device.Performance:The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G boasts the world's first Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 chipset, and it truly lives up to the hype. The 6GB RAM paired with the powerful processor ensures smooth multitasking and lag-free performance even with heavy applications and games. I haven't faced any stuttering or slowdowns, and the 5G capability provides super-fast internet connectivity.Display:The 120Hz refresh rate on this phone is a game-changer. Scrolling through apps and websites is incredibly smooth and fluid. The colors are vibrant, and the display quality is top-notch. Whether you're watching videos or playing games, the visual experience is simply outstanding.Storage:With 128GB of internal storage, there's plenty of space for all my apps, photos, and videos. Plus, if you need more storage, you can always expand it using a microSD card, which is a convenient feature.Battery Life:The battery life is impressive as well. Even with heavy usage, the phone manages to last through the day comfortably. The inclusion of a charger in the box is a thoughtful touch, and it supports fast charging, which ensures you can quickly top up your battery when needed.Camera:The camera performance is good for the price range. The 48MP main sensor captures detailed and sharp images, especially in well-lit conditions. The 5MP macro and 2MP depth sensors are decent additions, but they don't deliver exceptional results in challenging lighting situations.Build Quality:The phone feels sturdy and well-built in hand. The Stellar Green color variant looks stunning with its unique gradient design. The device is also relatively lightweight, making it comfortable to carry around.Value for Money:Considering the features and performance, I believe the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G offers incredible value for money. It competes with devices that are priced higher but delivers a comparable experience at a more affordable price point.Overall, I highly recommend the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G to anyone in the market for a powerful and feature-packed smartphone without breaking the bank. It's a well-rounded device that won't disappoint you, especially if you appreciate a smooth display, fast performance, and 5G connectivity.",5.0 out of 5 stars
