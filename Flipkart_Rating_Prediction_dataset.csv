0,"As a retired (70s) person I needed a phone for Calling, Messaging, Entertainment, Browsing and Chrome casting. This phone is OK. But the weight of the phone gives pain in my fingers. Using Jio Router for WiFi. Although phone has dual band Wi-Fi capability, 2.4GHZ only gave a speed of 22 while 5GHZ gave full 30mbps. My old Realme phone only single band gives full 30 at the same spot. But overall it is still value for money for hard pressed oldies like me. On 22nd July, after 3 days of purchase I was pleased to receive MIUI 14 which is Android 13. Tested all features of Android 13 and so far no problems.I am writing again after 3 days of using MIUI 14 ie Android 13. Suddenly after 2 days my apps are behaving strangely. Calculator has no numeric pad, Battery Icon doesn't show %, drop down Status bar tray is showing only few icons. Immediately took it to MI service centre and new software was installed in 45 mts. and phone seems to work well with Android 13. Keeping fingers crossed. I have now visited MI Service Centre 3 times since my device was purchased on 19th July and still crashing. I hope MI will take up the matter seriously and not do a shoddy warranty job. I have not at all used the phone even for a single day.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1,"Over heating problem.. I gifted it to my father... He is too much complaining about over heating.. It's not easy for him to use.. He dislike it very much..... . After using it.. Don't go for it. Now redmi has lots of issues. I giveIt 4 star because review will highlight, other wise 1star review always apper last. Due to usual setting.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2,"Here is my honest review of the Redmi 12C smartphone:Pros:Good performance - The MediaTek Helio G85 processor and 4GB RAM provide smooth performance for day-to-day tasks and light gaming.Large display - It has a 6.71-inch HD+ display which is nice for watching videos and gaming. The teardrop notch is unobtrusive.Excellent battery life - With a large 5000mAh battery, the 12C can easily last 1.5-2 days of use on a single charge. Standby time is fantastic.Decent cameras - The 13MP rear and 5MP front cameras capture decent shots in good lighting conditions. The AI camera features are nice to have.Affordable price - Starting at just Rs. 8,999, the 12C offers good value considering the large display, battery and performance.Cons:Dated design - The thick bezels and plastic body make it look outdated compared to competitors. Build quality could be better.Average low-light photography - The cameras struggle in low light situations with visible noise. No ultra-wide or macro lens.Only 18W charging - Charging the large 5000mAh battery is slow with the included 18W charger. No support for faster charging.HD display - The display has only HD+ resolution (1600 x 720 pixels) resulting in less sharpness compared to Full HD displays.Overall, the Redmi 12C is a decent affordable smartphone for basic use and light gaming. It excels in battery life but has an outdated design and average camera performance. For the price, it's a good option for budget buyers who prioritize battery life and core performance. But those wanting better design or cameras can consider other options.",3.0 out of 5 stars
3,"Camera does have 50 megapixel but you will get only portrait, normal, night, HDR and time lapse modes. I think night mode can be better.It is quite easy to use and is quite a sturdy one.It doesn't heat much but it can if you play high quality games which requires more functions like PUBG.Charging comes with normal one, there is no c type port and it takes its time to charge, no supercharge function.Appearance wise it's one of the best, you get great colour options and purple looks really good.I think this is a good budget phone.",4.0 out of 5 stars
4,"Good built quality and appearance.Dislikes -many basic features that are only software related are also dropped for no reason.No new control center.Camera app don't have panorama, slow motion, document, AI modes. They are all software related not hardware which doesn't cost anything.Same way gallery editor is restricted of many common features like auto adjust image, colour focus filters etc.Auto brightness has some difficulty in adjustment.No live wallpaper,no always on display.Home screen grid is limited to only 4x4 and 5x5 in such a big screen. It should be atleast upto 5X7 option.No option to pin window or floating window, or split screen app option from recent menu.Hardware side -IR blaster, gyroscope sensor for compass, proximity sensor are missing for cost cutting.Type C charging port also dropped which is unbelievable.Extreme thick bazels and big lower space is just increased the size of phone.The weight is more than expected and size is also very big (even bigger than my redmi note 10 pro). God knows the reason behind making such bulky oversize phones. You cannot find any smaller size phone in the market.Screen quality, sound quality, camera quality are acceptable at this price range. No issue faced.Fingerprint sensor is at very high position, difficult to reach, and frequently you will touch camera lens instead of FP sensor because of the placement.Conclusion:On overall, it's basically a good hardware side purchase at this price range with very basic features (especially for elders and family members. But again too bulky for elders).On software side complete disappointment from MIUI for removing very basic features from its applications for no good reason.",3.0 out of 5 stars

6,"I recently had the chance to explore the Redmi 12C in Matte Black, and my experience has been a combination of both positive and not-so-positive aspects. Here's a detailed breakdown:Pros:High-Performance Processor: The inclusion of the Mediatek Helio G85 processor brings a noticeable boost in performance, ensuring smoother multitasking and responsiveness.Excellent Battery Life: The battery life on the Redmi 12C is certainly a standout feature. It holds up impressively even during extended use, reducing the need for frequent charges.Cons:Display Performance: While the display is good overall, it falls short of being exceptional. Colors and clarity are satisfactory, but I expected a bit more vibrancy and sharpness.Sound Quality: Unfortunately, the sound quality did not meet my expectations. The audio output lacks the depth and richness I anticipated, which can impact the overall multimedia experience.MIUI OS: The MIUI operating system brings its own set of challenges. The user experience could be smoother, and certain functionalities, such as the contact search not showing recently added contacts and a delay in recent call history list updates, have been noticeable issues.Camera Performance: The camera's performance is average, offering acceptable results but not quite meeting the high standards set by other devices in this category.The Redmi 12C brings a mix of features to the table, with some aspects that shine and others that leave room for improvement. The high-performance processor and remarkable battery life are commendable, providing an enhanced user experience. However, areas like display vibrancy, sound quality, and the MIUI OS experience could use further refinement. While the camera captures moments adequately, it doesn't deliver exceptional results. For those seeking a budget-friendly option with a balance of strengths and weaknesses, the Redmi 12C could be considered. Keep in mind the trade-offs and decide based on your priorities.",4.0 out of 5 stars
7,"Man I bought this phone just as a timepass coz my X2 Pro broke and died. So I was saving money to buy GT 2 PRO, so just for the time being I bought this 7K phone, and BOY I am surprised by its performance.

18,It's been 1 day I am using this phone and as of now the phone charges fast it takes around 1.5 hr for full charge and i have used 1 full day with 100% charge and at night it cane to 60% so battery backup is good and canera quality is nice for this price coming to storage the system occupies around 12 gb it is a negative point so I suggest u to go with 128gb mobile and as you know it is Redmi so there is little bit lag in the phone and overall it is OK for this price.

61,"Purchased on August 2023 for ‚Çπ13500Except for the exynos chip, specs are good in paper. Bought for a parent, who is a moderate user. The phone works fine as expected, for calling, browsing, watching movies, social media usage etc. Being an entry level smartphone, samsung could have provided the charger.Dont expect any miracles from this phone. A normal camera and an entry level processor. Not for gaming or exteme usage. OneUI core doesn't include many features in normal OneUI, but all the common features are present. Usually, a non enthusiast would never notice the eliminated features.Note: OneUI doesn't have internet speed meternon status bar, have to use 3rd party apps. Also blocking internet usage for specific apps is a little bit pain in the ass, if you have to do it. Except these, OneUI is the best smartphone UI, in my opinion.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The screen clarity was not good.. the images were appearing more reddish/yellowish.. even video clarity was very poor.. the videos in 720p seemed more clear in my earlier phone M30s rather than videos in 1080p in this phone.2. In the name security the phone was hiding all the data & shows white screen (snap attached) when you switch between applications. you can only see app icons which is very hectic thing when you have type anything from one to another specially like otp or numbers..3. And the worst part was screenshot... the phone was not allowing me to take screenshot in any app or any case due its security policy...I complained on Samsung members app also contacted online samsung customer care but didn't help..(online support is worst.. they treats you like a old school guy like you know nothing about smartphone)After visiting Samsung Customer Care in person, they reseted the software. From thereon the phone is now working fine the problems as above are resolved.",3.0 out of 5 stars
80,"I recently had the opportunity to use the latest smartphone model, and I must say that my experience was a mixed bag. While it does have some noteworthy features, there are several areas where improvements are needed.Starting with the positives, the battery backup of this device is commendable. It offers an impressive lifespan, allowing me to use it throughout the day without constantly worrying about running out of power. This is definitely a strong advantage for users who heavily rely on their smartphones for various tasks.However, I encountered a few drawbacks that significantly impacted my overall satisfaction. Firstly, the back panels of the device produce an unpleasant noise when held, which can be quite irritating and diminishes the overall quality of the phone. Additionally, the display did not meet my expectations. The visual quality and clarity fell short, resulting in a subpar viewing experience. This is an important aspect of any smartphone, and I was disappointed by the underwhelming display performance.Furthermore, the camera capabilities of the device were average at best. While it managed to capture decent photos in well-lit environments, it struggled in low-light situations, resulting in grainy and lackluster images. Considering the significance of smartphone photography in today's world, this is an area that could definitely benefit from improvement.Another frustrating aspect was the network connectivity issues. There were instances where the phone failed to establish a stable internet connection, necessitating a restart. This inconvenience disrupted my workflow and hindered my ability to access online content seamlessly. Additionally, I found the GPS to be unreliable, with frequent calibration problems and poor detection accuracy. This was particularly frustrating when relying on navigation apps or location-based services.",3.0 out of 5 stars

110,"There is nothing I dislike about this phone. Only my expectations were too high after watching the several youtuber's reviews. Nothing special about this phone either. Hence the 3 star rating.I upgraded to this phone from a four year old Realme 3 (4/64 GB). But my old phone still beats this one in terms of speed. The 4000 mAH battery of Realme 3 gave me the same backup 4 years ago which this 6000 mAH in this phone gives me now.The phone comes with lots of bloatware. You can uninstall many of the useless apps. But there still remain many samsung apps which I don't use and I cannot uninstall. Samsung pay cannot store your credit card information. Only UPI and your IDs etc can be kept there. If you want to use credit card in any online transaction, you will still have to take the plastic card out of your pocket to punch in the details if you do not memorize it.The more weight and thickness of this phone are the only cons for me.

114,I didn't like the SIM tray setup. It's inconvenient to swap/change SIMs. Having a base to hold the SIMs in place would have been helpful.Biggest disappointment is on the exchange program. Amazon is relying on DA to assess the phone and they are always trying to reduce the value if they suspect a minor thing. I'm my case a discoloration corners was concluded as screen defect and was advised to pay the balance amount if wanted to go ahead with exchange. I was not given any payment receipt and informed that the information would be available on my Amazon account. It is still not available even after 5 days and it looks like I was tricked on this.

If you use your ur phone all day then you have to charge in the middle. Simple games also runs effectively but not for heavy games like BGMI only gives 30 fps, though its very clear this smartphone is not targeted for gaming audience. If u want a budget phone to do daily stuff (browsing, social media, whatsapp, payments, camera etc) with good after sales service and from a prominent brand with no bugs and glitches here and there then u won't have any issue.

140,"I have purchased this phone for my mother, this is her first smart phone so i thought i should go for a simple smartphone with clean ui with a large battery. So bought this. Now let's talk about the pros and consPros:1. Large screen: the screen is really big and colours are bright.2. Large battery: 5000 mah battery is really useful, my mother doesn't use the phone too much so it's last for 2 to 3 days with minimal usage.3. Android go : it has the Android 13 go edition so it's light version that's why it's working smooth.4. Dual rear camera does it's job but the front camera is really impressive.5.Dialer: It has Xiaomi dialer so you can record call without announcement.Cons :1. No type C port so we have to carry an extra cable as all of our phone has type C port.2. Long Charging time: no fast charging provided so it's taking longer time to charge the battery.3. No widget options ( till now August 2023) so you can't add weather or clock or contact widget on the home screen.4. No double tap to screen on/off feature ( till now Aug 2023).5. It's taking time to load videos or the settings options on 2gb variant, i mean if i open YouTube it's taking 4 to 5 second to load the videos on YouTube ( I'm using the device on WiFi so no network issue, it's happening for the weak processor). I have installed WhatsApp from play store, nothing else installed on the phone but still it's taking some times for some app loading. But it's okay it's not a issue for someone who just started using smartphone.Also you can uninstall or disable maximum of preloaded apps. I have uninstalled maximum of those apps. Also I have disabled the Chrome browser, as my mother didn't search any thing on internet. I have disabled the browser so even if my mother clicked on any link on YouTube or on another apps it doesn't work so kind of safe for my mother also.So i just want to say this phone is just for calling, WhatsApp, for normal YouTube videos & music. Also i think if you are getting the 2GB variant under 6k then it's a good deal. Don't pay more for this even if you are buying 4gb 64gb it will not change much on the performance.Thank you.Edit 1 : Even after getting 3 software updates they didn't include the widgets option as well as the double tap function. So i think this option will not available in future also, may be this features are not for Android go editions. So keep that in mind, although my mother never complaint about the clok as she check the time from the notification bar or from the lock screen.",4.0 out of 5 stars

142,"After using it for a month, I can state , the Redmi A2 (Classic Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) is an excellent budget smartphone that delivers impressive features and performance. From its vibrant display to its capable cameras and long-lasting battery, it offers a well-rounded experience for the price. If you are looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone, I highly recommend considering the Redmi A2.Pros:1. Great value for money: The Redmi A2 offers an impressive range of features and performance at an affordable price point.2. Vibrant display: The 6.52-inch IPS LCD screen delivers sharp and clear visuals, making it enjoyable for multimedia consumption.3. Smooth performance: The Mediatek Helio G36 chipset, coupled with the octa-core processor and 4GB RAM, ensures smooth multitasking and lag-free performance.4. Expandable storage: The device comes with 64GB of internal storage, which can be further expanded using the dedicated microSDXC card slot, providing ample space for your files and apps.5. Decent camera performance: The dual rear cameras capture satisfactory photos with good detail and color accuracy, and the addition of features like dual-LED flash and HDR enhances the camera's capabilities.6. Long-lasting battery: The 5000mAh non-removable battery offers excellent battery life, allowing for a full day of usage without worrying about running out of power.7. User-friendly interface: The Redmi A2 runs on Android 13 (Go edition) with MIUI, providing a user-friendly interface and a range of customization options.8. Sleek design: The device boasts a sleek and slim design, with the Classic Black color variant adding an elegant touch.9. Added benefit is warranty - 2 years [1 year + extra 1 year (special introductory offer)]Cons:1. Moderate display resolution: While the display is vibrant, the 720 x 1600 pixel resolution may not offer the highest level of sharpness compared to higher-end devices.2. Modest camera setup: The camera setup on the Redmi A2 is modest, which may not satisfy users who require advanced camera capabilities.3. Limited charging speed: The device supports 10W wired charging, which is not as fast as some other smartphones in the market.Please be aware that these benefits and drawbacks are based on individual usage and may change based on preferences and usage patterns.",4.0 out of 5 stars
143,"Nice mobile in this price range I get it for only 5.4k it's an good price1 camera: camera üì∏ quality is very nice for camera 5/52 gaming : in this price range it comes with an good processor no lag on small games like temple run , Subway surfers ect 4/53 display: the display quality is also good at this price range 4/54 battery: battery will last upto more than 8 hrs on simple use like browsing , YouTube,calls ,camera 4/55 charging time: it comes with 10w changer it takes more than 4 hrs to Full change 4/5Overall score is 4/5",4.0 out of 5 stars
144,"Before saying anything about A2, I would like to mention properly that is a below ‚Çπ7,000 smartphone. In this slab of pricing, Xiaomi has packed a USB charger, decent battery which goes on from 13-15 hours in good use (non gaming, movie etc) in single charge.Camera is good, not exceptional.The OS feels like Stock Android. As Classic MIUI Apps seemed missing by me like notes, compass, IR Remote.Does not support 5GHz Wifi. Works smooth on 2.4Ghz Wifi.The built qualify is simply AWESOME. Feel in hand is Awesome.Brithness is pretty good, touch and response time is very smooth and fast. Bootup time is pretty fast too.Comes with a dedicated SD Card slot along with dual sim slots (total 3 slots in tray).In box they have packed the phone, charger, USB type A-B cable. (No tempered glass or back cover), No fingerprint or face unlock - REMEMBER THE PRICE.Final conclusion: the phone is good in this price range specially the smoothness, built quality, screen size, clean Android OS with majority Google's Apps like Google One, Google Gallery etc. Yes some small small things are missing but that is fine because the price is also kept pretty low. The Phone is good for those who have average use of smartphones or if you want to make this as a secondary business need smartphone. Or simply a phone for a school student.I recommend this product untill and unless Redmi asks you to pay more than ‚Çπ7500.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The 6.5-inch FHD+ display is crystal clear and provides a great viewing experience for watching videos or playing games.The performance of the Redmi 10 Power is exceptional, thanks to the 8GB RAM and the powerful Snapdragon 662 processor. The phone runs smoothly and seamlessly, and I have not experienced any lag or slowdown even when multitasking or running resource-intensive apps.The battery life of the Redmi 10 Power is simply outstanding. With a massive 6000mAh battery, I can easily go through an entire day of heavy usage without needing to recharge. And when I do need to charge the phone, the 18W fast charger included in the box quickly charges the battery back up.The camera on this phone is also impressive, with a 48MP quad-camera setup that captures stunning photos and videos. The AI scene recognition and night mode features are particularly noteworthy, as they allow me to take great photos in low-light conditions.Overall, I would highly recommend the Redmi 10 Power to anyone looking for a powerful, feature-packed smartphone at an affordable price. It is an excellent value for money, and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase",4.0 out of 5 stars

The screen clarity was not good.. the images were appearing more reddish/yellowish.. even video clarity was very poor.. the videos in 720p seemed more clear in my earlier phone M30s rather than videos in 1080p in this phone.2. In the name security the phone was hiding all the data & shows white screen (snap attached) when you switch between applications. you can only see app icons which is very hectic thing when you have type anything from one to another specially like otp or numbers..3. And the worst part was screenshot... the phone was not allowing me to take screenshot in any app or any case due its security policy...I complained on Samsung members app also contacted online samsung customer care but didn't help..(online support is worst.. they treats you like a old school guy like you know nothing about smartphone)After visiting Samsung Customer Care in person, they reseted the software.

440,"I recently had the opportunity to use the latest smartphone model, and I must say that my experience was a mixed bag. While it does have some noteworthy features, there are several areas where improvements are needed.Starting with the positives, the battery backup of this device is commendable. It offers an impressive lifespan, allowing me to use it throughout the day without constantly worrying about running out of power. This is definitely a strong advantage for users who heavily rely on their smartphones for various tasks.However, I encountered a few drawbacks that significantly impacted my overall satisfaction. Firstly, the back panels of the device produce an unpleasant noise when held, which can be quite irritating and diminishes the overall quality of the phone. Additionally, the display did not meet my expectations. The visual quality and clarity fell short, resulting in a subpar viewing experience. This is an important aspect of any smartphone, and I was disappointed by the underwhelming display performance.Furthermore, the camera capabilities of the device were average at best. While it managed to capture decent photos in well-lit environments, it struggled in low-light situations, resulting in grainy and lackluster images. Considering the significance of smartphone photography in today's world, this is an area that could definitely benefit from improvement.Another frustrating aspect was the network connectivity issues. There were instances where the phone failed to establish a stable internet connection, necessitating a restart. This inconvenience disrupted my workflow and hindered my ability to access online content seamlessly.

Hence the 3 star rating.I upgraded to this phone from a four year old Realme 3 (4/64 GB). But my old phone still beats this one in terms of speed. The 4000 mAH battery of Realme 3 gave me the same backup 4 years ago which this 6000 mAH in this phone gives me now.The phone comes with lots of bloatware. You can uninstall many of the useless apps. But there still remain many samsung apps which I don't use and I cannot uninstall. Samsung pay cannot store your credit card information. Only UPI and your IDs etc can be kept there. If you want to use credit card in any online transaction, you will still have to take the plastic card out of your pocket to punch in the details if you do not memorize it.The more weight and thickness of this phone are the only cons for me.

I'm my case a discoloration corners was concluded as screen defect and was advised to pay the balance amount if wanted to go ahead with exchange. I was not given any payment receipt and informed that the information would be available on my Amazon account. It is still not available even after 5 days and it looks like I was tricked on this.

500,"The Samsung M04 offers a budget-friendly option with a 6.2-inch display, providing a decent viewing experience for its price point. Its performance is satisfactory for everyday tasks thanks to the Snapdragon processor and 3GB of RAM, though demanding apps or games might not run as smoothly.The camera setup, featuring a dual-lens rear camera with a 13MP main sensor and a 2MP depth sensor, captures acceptable photos in well-lit conditions, but struggles in low light. The front-facing 5MP camera is suitable for basic selfies and video calls.The device houses a 5,000mAh battery, which can easily last through a day of regular usage. However, charging is done through a micro-USB port, which might be a bit outdated for some users.On the software side, the M04 runs Samsung's One UI on top of Android, providing a user-friendly experience and some customization options. As for storage, the 32GB internal storage can be expanded via microSD card for those who need more space.In summary, the Samsung M04 is a decent budget smartphone that gets the basics done, but it's important to manage expectations given its limitations in terms of performance and camera quality, which are common trade-offs in this price range.",4.0 out of 5 stars

503,"The Samsung Galaxy M04 in Light Green may be budget-friendly, but it falls disappointingly short when it comes to camera performance. If you're someone who enjoys capturing life's moments with stunning clarity, this phone is bound to leave you feeling frustrated.Camera Performance:The 13MP primary camera on the Galaxy M04 struggles to produce satisfactory results, especially in anything less than optimal lighting conditions. Photos taken indoors or in low-light environments suffer from excessive noise and lack of detail. Even in well-lit settings, the colors appear muted, and the dynamic range is limited. The 5MP front camera is equally lackluster, producing selfies that lack sharpness and clarity. If you're a photography enthusiast, this phone simply won't meet your expectations.Gaming Performance:While the Galaxy M04 manages day-to-day tasks adequately, it's not designed for high-performance gaming. Graphically demanding games often suffer from lag and frame rate drops, making the gaming experience less enjoyable. If you're into heavy mobile gaming, you'd be better off considering a more powerful device.Battery Life:Although the 5,000mAh battery is impressive on paper, the subpar gaming performance drains the battery quickly during extended gaming sessions. While the phone may suffice for parents who use it for occasional tasks, the battery life may not last a full day under heavy usage scenarios.Display:The 6.3-inch HD+ LCD display is mediocre at best. While it gets the job done for casual media consumption, the lack of vibrant colors and average viewing angles fail to impress. The visual experience simply doesn't match up to other smartphones in this price range.Software and Updates:Samsung's One UI skin is generally user-friendly, but the budget nature of this phone means that major updates and feature enhancements might not be promptly delivered. This could lead to missing out on essential improvements and security patches.Conclusion:If you're a photography enthusiast or a heavy mobile gamer, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green will be a major disappointment. The lackluster camera performance, subpar gaming capabilities, and average display make it unsuitable for users who prioritize these aspects. However, if you're a parent or a casual user who primarily needs a phone for basic tasks like calls, messaging, and light browsing, the Galaxy M04 might suffice. For anything more demanding, there are better options available in the market at a similar price point.Pros:Suitable for parents or casual users with basic needsAffordable price pointCons:Subpar camera performance in various lighting conditionsNot suitable for high-performance gamingMediocre display qualityPotential delays in major software updatesRating: 2.5/5",3.0 out of 5 stars

512,"I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy M04 in the eye-catching Light Green color variant, and I must say I am quite impressed with what this budget-friendly smartphone has to offer. At a price of just 7499, it delivers a compelling combination of features that cater to the needs of everyday users.Performance-wise, the Samsung Galaxy M04 is equipped with a MediaTek Helio P35 Octa-core processor, which handles day-to-day tasks and applications smoothly. The 4GB of RAM ensures multitasking is manageable, but what's interesting is the RAM Plus feature that allows users to utilize up to 8GB of RAM, providing extra headroom for demanding apps and games.With 64GB of onboard storage, there's ample space to store your favorite apps, photos, videos, and more. In case you need additional storage, the phone also supports expandable storage via a microSD card.The highlight of the Samsung Galaxy M04 is undoubtedly its long-lasting 5000mAh battery. For regular users, this battery capacity easily lasts a full day on a single charge, reducing the need to carry a charger around constantly. It's a relief to know that this phone won't leave you stranded with a dead battery when you need it the most.Moving on to the camera capabilities, the Galaxy M04 sports a 13MP dual-camera setup, which captures decent photos in good lighting conditions. While it might not produce the same quality images as high-end flagship devices, it certainly suffices for social media sharing and general photography needs. The camera app offers some useful features like portrait mode and various filters to enhance your photography experience.In terms of design, the Light Green color variant is refreshing and stands out from the usual black or white smartphones in the market. The phone's build quality feels solid, and the ergonomic design makes it comfortable to hold for extended periods.On the software front, the Samsung Galaxy M04 runs on the company's One UI, which is known for its user-friendly interface and customizability. With the latest Android version pre-installed, you can expect a smooth and familiar user experience.However, it's important to note that this phone might not be the best choice for heavy mobile gamers or those seeking cutting-edge performance, as it is more tailored for casual users with everyday needs.In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green edition is an excellent option for anyone looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone. With its striking design, impressive battery life, and the option to expand RAM, it offers great value for money at a price point of 7499. Whether you are a student, a professional, or someone who just needs a dependable device for day-to-day tasks, the Galaxy M04 won't disappoint.",5.0 out of 5 stars

560,"I have purchased this phone for my mother, this is her first smart phone so i thought i should go for a simple smartphone with clean ui with a large battery. So bought this. Now let's talk about the pros and consPros:1. Large screen: the screen is really big and colours are bright.2. Large battery: 5000 mah battery is really useful, my mother doesn't use the phone too much so it's last for 2 to 3 days with minimal usage.3. Android go : it has the Android 13 go edition so it's light version that's why it's working smooth.4. Dual rear camera does it's job but the front camera is really impressive.5.Dialer: It has Xiaomi dialer so you can record call without announcement.Cons :1. No type C port so we have to carry an extra cable as all of our phone has type C port.2. Long Charging time: no fast charging provided so it's taking longer time to charge the battery.3. No widget options ( till now August 2023) so you can't add weather or clock or contact widget on the home screen.4. No double tap to screen on/off feature ( till now Aug 2023).5. It's taking time to load videos or the settings options on 2gb variant, i mean if i open YouTube it's taking 4 to 5 second to load the videos on YouTube ( I'm using the device on WiFi so no network issue, it's happening for the weak processor). I have installed WhatsApp from play store, nothing else installed on the phone but still it's taking some times for some app loading. But it's okay it's not a issue for someone who just started using smartphone.Also you can uninstall or disable maximum of preloaded apps. I have uninstalled maximum of those apps. Also I have disabled the Chrome browser, as my mother didn't search any thing on internet. I have disabled the browser so even if my mother clicked on any link on YouTube or on another apps it doesn't work so kind of safe for my mother also.So i just want to say this phone is just for calling, WhatsApp, for normal YouTube videos & music. Also i think if you are getting the 2GB variant under 6k then it's a good deal. Don't pay more for this even if you are buying 4gb 64gb it will not change much on the performance.Thank you.Edit 1 : Even after getting 3 software updates they didn't include the widgets option as well as the double tap function. So i think this option will not available in future also, may be this features are not for Android go editions. So keep that in mind, although my mother never complaint about the clok as she check the time from the notification bar or from the lock screen.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Vibrant display: The 6.52-inch IPS LCD screen delivers sharp and clear visuals, making it enjoyable for multimedia consumption.3. Smooth performance: The Mediatek Helio G36 chipset, coupled with the octa-core processor and 4GB RAM, ensures smooth multitasking and lag-free performance.4. Expandable storage: The device comes with 64GB of internal storage, which can be further expanded using the dedicated microSDXC card slot, providing ample space for your files and apps.5. Decent camera performance: The dual rear cameras capture satisfactory photos with good detail and color accuracy, and the addition of features like dual-LED flash and HDR enhances the camera's capabilities.6. Long-lasting battery: The 5000mAh non-removable battery offers excellent battery life, allowing for a full day of usage without worrying about running out of power.7. User-friendly interface: The Redmi A2 runs on Android 13 (Go edition) with MIUI, providing a user-friendly interface and a range of customization options.8. Sleek design: The device boasts a sleek and slim design, with the Classic Black color variant adding an elegant touch.9. Added benefit is warranty - 2 years [1 year + extra 1 year (special introductory offer)]Cons:1. Moderate display resolution: While the display is vibrant, the 720 x 1600 pixel resolution may not offer the highest level of sharpness compared to higher-end devices.2. Modest camera setup: The camera setup on the Redmi A2 is modest, which may not satisfy users who require advanced camera capabilities.3. Limited charging speed: The device supports 10W wired charging, which is not as fast as some other smartphones in the market.Please be aware that these benefits and drawbacks are based on individual usage and may change based on preferences and usage patterns.",4.0 out of 5 stars

564,"Before saying anything about A2, I would like to mention properly that is a below ‚Çπ7,000 smartphone. In this slab of pricing, Xiaomi has packed a USB charger, decent battery which goes on from 13-15 hours in good use (non gaming, movie etc) in single charge.Camera is good, not exceptional.The OS feels like Stock Android. As Classic MIUI Apps seemed missing by me like notes, compass, IR Remote.Does not support 5GHz Wifi. Works smooth on 2.4Ghz Wifi.The built qualify is simply AWESOME. Feel in hand is Awesome.Brithness is pretty good, touch and response time is very smooth and fast. Bootup time is pretty fast too.Comes with a dedicated SD Card slot along with dual sim slots (total 3 slots in tray).In box they have packed the phone, charger, USB type A-B cable. (No tempered glass or back cover), No fingerprint or face unlock - REMEMBER THE PRICE.Final conclusion: the phone is good in this price range specially the smoothness, built quality, screen size, clean Android OS with majority Google's Apps like Google One, Google Gallery etc. Yes some small small things are missing but that is fine because the price is also kept pretty low. The Phone is good for those who have average use of smartphones or if you want to make this as a secondary business need smartphone. Or simply a phone for a school student.I recommend this product untill and unless Redmi asks you to pay more than ‚Çπ7500.",4.0 out of 5 stars

640,"The Samsung M04 offers a budget-friendly option with a 6.2-inch display, providing a decent viewing experience for its price point. Its performance is satisfactory for everyday tasks thanks to the Snapdragon processor and 3GB of RAM, though demanding apps or games might not run as smoothly.The camera setup, featuring a dual-lens rear camera with a 13MP main sensor and a 2MP depth sensor, captures acceptable photos in well-lit conditions, but struggles in low light. The front-facing 5MP camera is suitable for basic selfies and video calls.The device houses a 5,000mAh battery, which can easily last through a day of regular usage. However, charging is done through a micro-USB port, which might be a bit outdated for some users.On the software side, the M04 runs Samsung's One UI on top of Android, providing a user-friendly experience and some customization options. As for storage, the 32GB internal storage can be expanded via microSD card for those who need more space.In summary, the Samsung M04 is a decent budget smartphone that gets the basics done, but it's important to manage expectations given its limitations in terms of performance and camera quality, which are common trade-offs in this price range.",4.0 out of 5 stars

643,"The Samsung Galaxy M04 in Light Green may be budget-friendly, but it falls disappointingly short when it comes to camera performance. If you're someone who enjoys capturing life's moments with stunning clarity, this phone is bound to leave you feeling frustrated.Camera Performance:The 13MP primary camera on the Galaxy M04 struggles to produce satisfactory results, especially in anything less than optimal lighting conditions. Photos taken indoors or in low-light environments suffer from excessive noise and lack of detail. Even in well-lit settings, the colors appear muted, and the dynamic range is limited. The 5MP front camera is equally lackluster, producing selfies that lack sharpness and clarity. If you're a photography enthusiast, this phone simply won't meet your expectations.Gaming Performance:While the Galaxy M04 manages day-to-day tasks adequately, it's not designed for high-performance gaming. Graphically demanding games often suffer from lag and frame rate drops, making the gaming experience less enjoyable. If you're into heavy mobile gaming, you'd be better off considering a more powerful device.Battery Life:Although the 5,000mAh battery is impressive on paper, the subpar gaming performance drains the battery quickly during extended gaming sessions. While the phone may suffice for parents who use it for occasional tasks, the battery life may not last a full day under heavy usage scenarios.Display:The 6.3-inch HD+ LCD display is mediocre at best. While it gets the job done for casual media consumption, the lack of vibrant colors and average viewing angles fail to impress. The visual experience simply doesn't match up to other smartphones in this price range.Software and Updates:Samsung's One UI skin is generally user-friendly, but the budget nature of this phone means that major updates and feature enhancements might not be promptly delivered. This could lead to missing out on essential improvements and security patches.Conclusion:If you're a photography enthusiast or a heavy mobile gamer, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green will be a major disappointment. The lackluster camera performance, subpar gaming capabilities, and average display make it unsuitable for users who prioritize these aspects. However, if you're a parent or a casual user who primarily needs a phone for basic tasks like calls, messaging, and light browsing, the Galaxy M04 might suffice. For anything more demanding, there are better options available in the market at a similar price point.Pros:Suitable for parents or casual users with basic needsAffordable price pointCons:Subpar camera performance in various lighting conditionsNot suitable for high-performance gamingMediocre display qualityPotential delays in major software updatesRating: 2.5/5",3.0 out of 5 stars

652,"I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy M04 in the eye-catching Light Green color variant, and I must say I am quite impressed with what this budget-friendly smartphone has to offer. At a price of just 7499, it delivers a compelling combination of features that cater to the needs of everyday users.Performance-wise, the Samsung Galaxy M04 is equipped with a MediaTek Helio P35 Octa-core processor, which handles day-to-day tasks and applications smoothly. The 4GB of RAM ensures multitasking is manageable, but what's interesting is the RAM Plus feature that allows users to utilize up to 8GB of RAM, providing extra headroom for demanding apps and games.With 64GB of onboard storage, there's ample space to store your favorite apps, photos, videos, and more. In case you need additional storage, the phone also supports expandable storage via a microSD card.The highlight of the Samsung Galaxy M04 is undoubtedly its long-lasting 5000mAh battery. For regular users, this battery capacity easily lasts a full day on a single charge, reducing the need to carry a charger around constantly. It's a relief to know that this phone won't leave you stranded with a dead battery when you need it the most.Moving on to the camera capabilities, the Galaxy M04 sports a 13MP dual-camera setup, which captures decent photos in good lighting conditions. While it might not produce the same quality images as high-end flagship devices, it certainly suffices for social media sharing and general photography needs. The camera app offers some useful features like portrait mode and various filters to enhance your photography experience.In terms of design, the Light Green color variant is refreshing and stands out from the usual black or white smartphones in the market. The phone's build quality feels solid, and the ergonomic design makes it comfortable to hold for extended periods.On the software front, the Samsung Galaxy M04 runs on the company's One UI, which is known for its user-friendly interface and customizability. With the latest Android version pre-installed, you can expect a smooth and familiar user experience.However, it's important to note that this phone might not be the best choice for heavy mobile gamers or those seeking cutting-edge performance, as it is more tailored for casual users with everyday needs.In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green edition is an excellent option for anyone looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone. With its striking design, impressive battery life, and the option to expand RAM, it offers great value for money at a price point of 7499. Whether you are a student, a professional, or someone who just needs a dependable device for day-to-day tasks, the Galaxy M04 won't disappoint.",5.0 out of 5 stars

In a best way possible, the phone is designed to only show what the user wants and eliminating unnecessary ads, features that I have seen in android.Why it is better than Android?You pay too much money for Apple products, obviously you experience the features, physical components , camera lens etc. Apart from basic things, you can also enjoy the best applications available in app store. If you are a developer you might know the app store policy for application publish and their security posture towards handling payment apps etc. They publish best application and the way the apps, its modules switches is just flawless. Due to the so called strict policy of privacy program with Apple products, iPhone can pop up a box in your screen if any apps wants to track your activity with other applications. +1 respect for apple to show such concern with user.Apple phones are same ? like 13 vs 14The reason 14 is same as 13 may be business practice followed from 11th edition. But please note that iPhone making changes internally like physical components (small change in battery performance, lens in 14 edition), additional features but that may not satisfy you to buy 14 edition. If you do not find ""the very few changes"" interesting in 14, go for 13. Because physical and even cameras are not visually very much different in 13 vs 14 comparison. Also you get 13 for cheap :)14 is just added features but that is not for daily use, the features real time use is rare case. But the best part is there is no extra cost between 13 vs 14 prices (except extra 10k slash)Concern you must have.Apple is not giving chargers and their silicon cases are very expensive (but very good in touch and scratch friendly in back due to silk layer). This is an issue for sure. You have to buy charger not coming with USB C and claiming that you help carbon footprint, understandable but not customer friendly business model. Even after the purchase I had to spend at least 7k for charger and case.Apple care.I am not buying it, I pay for phone which is already expensive for this premium and apple care does have strict policy that if you understand that is waste. Instead I find a private insurance to make things better.",5.0 out of 5 stars

702,Delivery experience was very good and i received genuine product.Phone review:The phone is nothing extra ordinary. The features of the phone are as par compared to basic mid-range budget phones from andriod.As far as camera goes the dynamic range of is it very good without any much color correction.Rest every thing is just average.You should go for this only if your an apple user fan or you always wanted an iphone.,4.0 out of 5 stars
703,"It is just a review from my side so that its good for you to know before buying rather than regretting later.Positives:* Showoff* Camera* Sound* Security (they say, bt that blocks so many accessibility options for me)* So many awesome features as all iphone users say (which probably I will use once in a lifetime)Negatives for me (You may like it):1. No shortcut to change between vibration and no vibration frequently.2. No end call button on the lock screen.3. Call list is nonsense. It shows phone, whatsap and all other calls in same list.4. Go to a specific contact in call history n you can see only history of one day. Total length of call history is 100. Most probably you will not be able to find call history of previous week for a specific contact.5. Need of Itunes to copy music from PC to phone.6. No file manager like android where we can see and access complete folder structure.7. No silent and vibrate mode notification on screen.8. Need to buy separate adapter n earphones after already spending double.9. Cannot remove torch icon in iphone14 from lock screen. You may end up switching it on unwillingly.10. BT and WiFi shortcuts will just disconnect them. To turn off you need to go to Settings screen and turn it off again.11. In so many places, either text or files, there is no Select All option. (I'm waiting for android users to get all pics received in whatsapp after a trip).12. Takes a lot of time to get detected by devices when hotspot is on.13. At some screen you get stuck and you will miss the back button.14. Copy some mp3 files to your iphone and you will never be able to find it with default music app.15. Every app will be either on lot of home screens or organised under some groups. You will never get a clean home screen with 2 or 3 most frequently used apps and all other apps in a swipe up menu like android.16. No fingerprint sensor.Adding to the list after using for 2 months:17. Cannot turn off camera shutter sound in general mode.18. No option to flag contact as spam/scam.19. If you connect wireless BT device, it won't show battery percentage of BT device.20. You get a notification while using phone and you miss to open it, then you will not see it until you remember yourself to open notification screen. Notification icons won't be pinned on top of the screen like Android.21. If you use 2 SIM and want to switch mobile data between SIMs, there is no shortcut than going to Settings screen. Also, cannot see current amount of data used or left.List goes on and on, try it yourself.. No iphone owner speaks about limitations. Some people like iphone for these and others hate it for these. If you can pay double and handle these adjustments with work arounds, go ahead. Once you unlock and give your phone to someone, or once you give access permissions to apps, even iphone is not most secure. Fr example, If you are driving and someone wants to use your phone for music/maps etc., then you have to give your password, because there is no fingerprint option and face recogniton feature will become dangerous option.",3.0 out of 5 stars

715," This review is for the people who want to shift from Android to Apple as I did .I used Xiaomi K20 pro as my last device .I have been an mi phone for last 10 years and was happy with the value for money offered from the mi and also the camera was top notch for the prices .Fast forward to 2023 , I brought apple 14 , I always wanted to buy iPhone but due to battery back up and high costs I kept postponing.And believe me iPhone is not a smart phone to be compared with any android phones , this is in league of its own , so no comparison of orange to apple for sure.Silky smooth ui, touch screen , camera , sound , display , battery back up : Simply superb.You may face little difficulties in shifting to iPhone but little patience is all you need and you will love it for sure",5.0 out of 5 stars

722,"The Apple iPhone 14 is overall a great phone for anyone who is looking for high speed, excellent camera quality, and a day-long of battery life. The squared-off sides are more comfortable to hold in your hand in my opinion. I purchased this one and so far my experience has been wonderful. Something I like about this phone is its fast speed along with the different options the camera gives you. I wouldn't say the iPhone 14 has a better camera than the 13, rather I think they are more similar and there wasn't a dramatic improvement. The battery life is something that I wish was a little longer. It last about an hour or two more than the average iPhone 13, but does charge faster. I have been able to receive about a 50% charge in 30 minutes. Another great feature of this phone is the painless eSIM setup. Being able to set up the SIM card virtually and not a physical transfer on your phone makes carrying over carriers from phone to phone much easier. battery lasts as long as the iPhone 13. As you may remember, it was much better than the iPhone 12. The iPhone 14 is a smooth, responsive phone and great for high-quality gaming or photo and video editing. Overall I think this is a great phone to purchase if you are looking for a durable and sustainable upgrade and I do think it is worth the extra hundred dollars from the 13.",5.0 out of 5 stars
723,Enjoying the product to the fullest. Since its an apple product so accuracy is at par. I bought red color and got many compliments as it stand out and the glass effect makes it shiny and more beautiful. Battery life is good. Once charges till 100% it stays on 100% for 2 hours which is amazing. Speed is awesome and there is no issue of getting hang as i have been playing pubg on this phone.

754,"I prefer to have some privacy in life, I think apple suite is bit more private than google. It respects user privacy if you are not using third party apps. My options were stock android without google (something like lineageOS) or iPhone. I tried lineageOS but there was always something breaking in my phone. It couldn't become my daily driver; I wish most of the things in android were open source like maps and some other proprietary google apps. In the current state, I was left with choosing iPhone. For long, I had debated with myself about buying iPhone or not, I was using OnePlus 7T for last 3.5 years. The phone stopped getting updates and had many bugs. The software changed a lot, I hated it. All these OEM betraying consumers made me switch to iPhone in the end. I can't trust any other brand to have the consistency like apple has. That's my take in the phone market. I wish there was a consistent bloat free android brand with a great camera.",5.0 out of 5 stars

780,"I have purchased this phone for my mother, this is her first smart phone so i thought i should go for a simple smartphone with clean ui with a large battery. So bought this. Now let's talk about the pros and consPros:1. Large screen: the screen is really big and colours are bright.2. Large battery: 5000 mah battery is really useful, my mother doesn't use the phone too much so it's last for 2 to 3 days with minimal usage.3. Android go : it has the Android 13 go edition so it's light version that's why it's working smooth.4. Dual rear camera does it's job but the front camera is really impressive.5.Dialer: It has Xiaomi dialer so you can record call without announcement.Cons :1. No type C port so we have to carry an extra cable as all of our phone has type C port.2. Long Charging time: no fast charging provided so it's taking longer time to charge the battery.3. No widget options ( till now August 2023) so you can't add weather or clock or contact widget on the home screen.4. No double tap to screen on/off feature ( till now Aug 2023).5. It's taking time to load videos or the settings options on 2gb variant, i mean if i open YouTube it's taking 4 to 5 second to load the videos on YouTube ( I'm using the device on WiFi so no network issue, it's happening for the weak processor). I have installed WhatsApp from play store, nothing else installed on the phone but still it's taking some times for some app loading. But it's okay it's not a issue for someone who just started using smartphone.Also you can uninstall or disable maximum of preloaded apps. I have uninstalled maximum of those apps. Also I have disabled the Chrome browser, as my mother didn't search any thing on internet. I have disabled the browser so even if my mother clicked on any link on YouTube or on another apps it doesn't work so kind of safe for my mother also.So i just want to say this phone is just for calling, WhatsApp, for normal YouTube videos & music. Also i think if you are getting the 2GB variant under 6k then it's a good deal. Don't pay more for this even if you are buying 4gb 64gb it will not change much on the performance.Thank you.Edit 1 : Even after getting 3 software updates they didn't include the widgets option as well as the double tap function. So i think this option will not available in future also, may be this features are not for Android go editions. So keep that in mind, although my mother never complaint about the clok as she check the time from the notification bar or from the lock screen.",4.0 out of 5 stars

782,"After using it for a month, I can state , the Redmi A2 (Classic Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) is an excellent budget smartphone that delivers impressive features and performance. From its vibrant display to its capable cameras and long-lasting battery, it offers a well-rounded experience for the price. If you are looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone, I highly recommend considering the Redmi A2.Pros:1. Great value for money: The Redmi A2 offers an impressive range of features and performance at an affordable price point.2. Vibrant display: The 6.52-inch IPS LCD screen delivers sharp and clear visuals, making it enjoyable for multimedia consumption.3. Smooth performance: The Mediatek Helio G36 chipset, coupled with the octa-core processor and 4GB RAM, ensures smooth multitasking and lag-free performance.4. Expandable storage: The device comes with 64GB of internal storage, which can be further expanded using the dedicated microSDXC card slot, providing ample space for your files and apps.5. Decent camera performance: The dual rear cameras capture satisfactory photos with good detail and color accuracy, and the addition of features like dual-LED flash and HDR enhances the camera's capabilities.6. Long-lasting battery: The 5000mAh non-removable battery offers excellent battery life, allowing for a full day of usage without worrying about running out of power.7. User-friendly interface: The Redmi A2 runs on Android 13 (Go edition) with MIUI, providing a user-friendly interface and a range of customization options.8. Sleek design: The device boasts a sleek and slim design, with the Classic Black color variant adding an elegant touch.9. Added benefit is warranty - 2 years [1 year + extra 1 year (special introductory offer)]Cons:1. Moderate display resolution: While the display is vibrant, the 720 x 1600 pixel resolution may not offer the highest level of sharpness compared to higher-end devices.2. Modest camera setup: The camera setup on the Redmi A2 is modest, which may not satisfy users who require advanced camera capabilities.3. Limited charging speed: The device supports 10W wired charging, which is not as fast as some other smartphones in the market.Please be aware that these benefits and drawbacks are based on individual usage and may change based on preferences and usage patterns.",4.0 out of 5 stars

784,"Before saying anything about A2, I would like to mention properly that is a below ‚Çπ7,000 smartphone. In this slab of pricing, Xiaomi has packed a USB charger, decent battery which goes on from 13-15 hours in good use (non gaming, movie etc) in single charge.Camera is good, not exceptional.The OS feels like Stock Android. As Classic MIUI Apps seemed missing by me like notes, compass, IR Remote.Does not support 5GHz Wifi. Works smooth on 2.4Ghz Wifi.The built qualify is simply AWESOME. Feel in hand is Awesome.Brithness is pretty good, touch and response time is very smooth and fast. Bootup time is pretty fast too.Comes with a dedicated SD Card slot along with dual sim slots (total 3 slots in tray).In box they have packed the phone, charger, USB type A-B cable. (No tempered glass or back cover), No fingerprint or face unlock - REMEMBER THE PRICE.Final conclusion: the phone is good in this price range specially the smoothness, built quality, screen size, clean Android OS with majority Google's Apps like Google One, Google Gallery etc. Yes some small small things are missing but that is fine because the price is also kept pretty low. The Phone is good for those who have average use of smartphones or if you want to make this as a secondary business need smartphone. Or simply a phone for a school student.I recommend this product untill and unless Redmi asks you to pay more than ‚Çπ7500.",4.0 out of 5 stars

952,"TL:DR:1) If you are on a really tight budget, you can go for this phone.2) The HiOS is very bloated, buggy, laggy OS. Eventhough this is based on Android 12, using this phone feels like a using a prehistoric, old OS3) If you can spend 1k~2k more, go for other manufacturers.4) TECNO should ditch their HiOS and stick to Pure android OS if they want to see success in the Indian market. The OS is destroying the performance of the phone which has really good H/W specs for this price point.PRO's:1) 4GB/6GB RAM and 64GB/128GB storage.2) Decent Processor and Graphics for entry level gaming3) Large Display4) Front Single and Rear Dual FlashCON's:1) For a full charge from 0% to 100%, it will take 3 to 3.5 Hours2) The HiOS is very bloated, buggy, laggy OS. Eventhough this is based on Android 12, using this phone feels like a using a prehistoric, old OS3) Lots and Lots of junk apps that cannot be removed. Palm Store is the worst of the lot, It keeps sending notifications even when the app is disabled.4) The battery life suffers because of the bloated operating system and the unwanted applications that are running in the background.5) Lack of battery optimization features in HiOS6) Doubtful if this device will receive future Android OS updates in the future (13/14) as TECNO has not mentioned anything about this on their website.7) Camera is not upto the mark and do not expect great pictures.8) The S/W based RAM extension is useless as the 64GB/128GB ROM is slow and using this as the extended RAM is equivalent to using the Mechanical HDD as the extended RAM on Desktop computers.",3.0 out of 5 stars

983,"Firstly and most importantly, there are plenty of better options available out there for similar price with better specs. I only bought this for the Love for NOKIA as a brand and name. Honestly Nokia has a looong way to go in order to be able even compete with the brands out there. now for the device. have been using it for almost 3 weeks and still running on Android 11 and no sign of any update of android 12. @nokia you really need to have a better support. your support team is as good as not being.screen - functional, could be better, nothing WOW, forget about gaming. @nokia has not specified if there is any protection on the screen or not and the support staff as usual is clue less.camera - main camera is just pathetic, front cam is average.Battery - 3 day battery life marketing is a gimmick and will only achieve if all background process is restricted and only basic functions like calls and WhatsApp being used. with heavy gaming and streaming will last hardly last a day.OS - the stock android is clean and crisp but you will miss functus like call recording without announcement, multi function calculator etc. However the play store works fast and smooth and the installation process is just as quick.Sensors - can't use compass ( Grrrrrrr,,,, big ouch) also the proximity sensor is not good and the screen gets activated during calls and your ear can touch and start or stop various buttons. the finger print is really annoying, every time you pickup o hold your phone your thumb unknowingly touches the sensor and the screen just turns on without your realizing it.speaker - no dual or stereo speaker sound is moderate.Mic - the other party hears a lots of background noise otherwise works fine.Dual sim - its a 4g phone and the dual sim + SD card fits and works perfectly3.5mm jack - available on the top which is really helpful in pocket or in the car but otherwise it takes some time to adjust to it.build quality - the first impression is just wow, color is wow, feelgood factor is wow and its big for the pocket. how ever there is a hollow sound when you tick on the screen from front or the back. the transparent cover is included in the box.Charging - least 2 hours till full with a fast charges with the inbox charge minimum 3 hours.the BT, wifi and NFC works seemlessly.i have tried to cover almost everything.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Otherwise is good not doubt to the powerful phone under the heavy trusted brand from Nokia is coming back to the indina market.,4.0 out of 5 stars
985,"First thing everyone should know. This phone takes about 36 hours to setup. A million updates that took more than a day and a checkin with Nokia service center which is surprisingly easy to find, the phone came alive. No problem since then.This phone is my conscious downgrade and so far, I haven't missed anything from my previous 60K phone. Works just as fine for all basic apps like Google apps, Swiggy, Amazon, youtube, Uber, audible and whatsapp. Its slow by a fraction of a second, but thats good. It helps me slow down and think if I really need to open the app. Its definitely a healthier phone and will move you away from the mental race to get the fastest response and let your brain actually process things",4.0 out of 5 stars

987,"Update on Earphones: I received (via Delhivery courier) my earphones within 2 weeks of scanning the QR code and following the instructions on the box and the site. Make sure that you fill in the CORRECT and COMPLETE details as they will check/VERIFY the same. I am happy that Nokia India kept their promise. (Only suggestion was that Nokia could have provided me an option to choose the colour of my earphones).******************A week since I received the phone ... and this is my personal opinion for my Nokia G21 (6/128). I already have a heavy duty mobile and chose the G21 as a secondary phone for routine work (not for gaming or photo/videography)Pros:- Feels comfortable in the hand, just the right weight for me.- Battery charge appears to last longer.- No unnecessary apps. All Google stock apps - some which can be uninstalled (the only 3rd party app Netflix can be uninstalled as well)- Camera is decent. Has 6x digital zoom for photos and 3x for videos.- Has 2 nano SIM slots and a separate slot for the SD card.- In the box, you get a protective plastic back case, pin, charger and cable.- Charging is via USB C port (which I feel is better).- Has call recording feature (via Google phone app). Also has screen recorder with 3 audio options (microphone/device/combo) - nice !- Amazon shipment was fast !Neutral:- Sound quality is good. Only 1 speaker - Nokia could have made this a dual speaker and upped the sound. (The sound level drops by a notch when the screen recorder is used but only with the combo audio option)- The 3.5mm audio headphone port is on the top of the phone.Cons:- Fingerprint Scanner/Reader: While the scanner is very responsive, there is an irritating mechanism where the scanner locks itself automatically for 30 seconds if it reads an unidentified print (3 times). This may look good from a security point of view but any touch of skin and the scanner goes mad. I got fed up and removed the fingerprint option - Nokia should provide a software update to let the user choose if the scanner lock option should be automatic or not (and even the 30 sec is an excess - let the user define the parameter).(Noticed that one of the apps closed off on its own but worked fine later on - could be an one-off glitch - if it persists, I will update the review)Giving it 4 stars (removing a star for the fingerprint scanner).",4.0 out of 5 stars
988,"This is for the 6GB/128GB/Nordic Blue variant.I have had this device for about a week now and overall happy with the purchase. Here are some of the pros and cons -Pros: Stock android (no bloatware), Great battery life (lasted a good 2 days easily with moderate use - video calls, youtube, browsing), crystal clear audio, no lags, shipping time was pretty good.Cons: No 5G (not sure if this is really a con, but lack of this may not make this device future proof). One day the phone froze when I tried to browse. I did not expect this to happen with 6GB RAM and stock android, but this could be because of the processor. I restarted the device and did not have this issue since (Could have been a software bug that cleared after a restart since it is fairly new). I know there are reviews here that complain about this, but it is a gadget after all and may have some teething issues. Need to give it some time, dont jump to conclusions right away. Hardware seems to be pretty good even with the Unisoc processor, so any other issue could be software related and could be fixed with updates or following some simple steps.Other features that dont matter much to me - Dual SIM (tested and working good), camera is not up to the mark but I did not buy this for the camera (I could care less about this feature, but Nokia should definitely improve on this).Every device has reviews that complain about something or the other. To me, Nokia is still a good trusted brand that sticks to basics and keeps everything simple (without the bells and whistles of other flagships, features of which are mostly useless but we end up paying a lot more for those unnecessary features and bloatware).Since the phone was used only for a week, cant really say much (hence rated it a 4, might change it after using for a month or so). This was bought for someone that needed good battery life, clear voice and WhatsApp calls and this perfectly fit the bill.Note: You also get free earpods with this, but they dont come in the box. You have to raise a request on Nokia after purchase and writing a review on Amazon. I am yet to claim that which should make this deal more sweeter (since I already got Rs. 750 off of the offer price of Rs. 14,999 when I purchased it).",4.0 out of 5 stars

993,"Update 30/12/2022:So, nokia advertised an offer on the box of this model's 6GB variant, to leave a review on amazon and get free earbuds. Six months later, they have had zero communication, let alone sending the free earbuds.The review below still stands irrespective of this, but I am taking off 3 stars, for shady and misleading practices.First of all it boggles me to see that the market is just swamped with the chinese phone brands, more than I can count on my fingers. As I never intend to buy any such brand, the options were limited. Nokia has been pushing out some good products recently, and since back in the 'nokia is king' years, a decade ago, I owned many handsets, 2300, 6600, N95, 5230 etc., there certainly was a nostalgic factor.The main things I like about this is1. Clean UI, minimal OEM customizations.2. Minimal bloatware, there were 2-3 apps installed as part of the first time setup process, but these can be quickly uninstalled.3. Guest mode, this might not be relevant to most users, but it is important if one wants to compartmentalize some of their activities/usage on phone, by signing up as another user(s). This feature was lacking (to my amazement) in some of other brands' flagships.4. Battery seems to be lasting well, a good 2 days or more with light usage (no gaming but web surfing, calls, chatting, videos etc.).Cons:1. Repairability: Not so much a con (unless you break your screen), but I think in terms of repairability, this phone is a moderate to high level. The phone accidentally fell hard, and the screen broke within the first month itself. Since over the years, I have self-repaired a couple of broken phone screen myself I decided to repair this too. The replacement screen costed 3000 rs. The disassembly went just fine, except two snags - 1) the battery has some really strong sticky tabs, so much that there is a high likelihood of bending the battery slab while taking it out, and 2) the screen is glued to the frame, instead of being bolted with screws, which makes the frame prone to scratching during repair.2. Teardrop screen: never liked these 'aberrations' of notch, punch hole or teardrop screens. Should have had a clean no-notch screen.Overall, I think going by the market price segment this phone is in, you may not be getting your 'bang for buck'. But for me, trust in a brand has always been highly important. That is why I have never bought a chinese brand. What is ironic, is that the old Nokia, HTC and LG, the clean players (for the most part) closed their shops. :-)Think about if you can really trust your phone. I hope the answer is in the affirmative. If not, this might be a good choice.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Finger print sensor is just a joke üòÑ, will work only 40% 60% you have to enter the password.6.When you are connected to Wifi , you get the icon as ""dot"" on the screen, instead the WiFi icon , however when you will drop down the GUI Interface you will be able to see the whole WiFi icon bedside the time and network bars6.The cpu is just worst. in this range 15k smartphone you can get Snapdragon or MediatakThat is better than this deceptive ridiculous processor.7.Most annoying thing after every app install your phone starts getting heavy and more simple apps make your useless, as I have not installed ajy gaming app if you do then you hve to through your phone into the water bucket to get it cool there8. look's like it doesn't have the cooling system, even talking oner call on phone, my ear felt 105 degree, it's a joke your phone gets too hot in voice call.9 while charging Even with the 10v 1.5 amp charger your phone gets too hot , in the market there are phone who have the capacity of 30w 60w 120w they didn't get hot like nokia G21 but G21 have the third grade chipset that makes the device feel hot even with 10w changer bloody HDM manufacturers sucked the money of poor people in the name of Nokia10.

Screen response3. Processor4. No heating issue even after hours of simultaneous torchur via hotspot, video streaming, online shoppingCons:1. The OS (operating system) software - the customised Android used in this phone has a lot of room for improvement.2. A very crucial feature of ""automatic call recording"" for all calls is missing. Currently it works for only those numbers which are not there in the address book. However this option should be available for all numbers by default.3. Hotspot takes time to respond to incoming connection requests.4. Some apps like Prime Video has compatibility issues - while the video is playing it doesnot expand to fill the full dimension of the screen.

1002,"Here are my thoughts on the phone written below.It‚Äôs a good as a second phone but there are some things to be desired.The good-The battery life is good, not the claimed 3 days but then it depends on the user. It more than survives over a day of heavy usage so that‚Äôs a plus. The screen is decent, not 1080p but it does have 90 hertz refresh rate which is very impressive in this price bracket. The screen does a good job with content, being a 720p display. The phone feels snappy in most cases but that‚Äôs mostly due to the combination of the display and the processor, don‚Äôt expect the apps to open instantaneously but it‚Äôs fast enough that it doesn‚Äôt feel laggy. Cameras are decent, not too good or too bad, don‚Äôt expect much from it. Stock android is sublime, there‚Äôs no bloatware whatsoever.The bad-The phone looks very generic and like every other budget phone, although I like the display overall; I do particularly wish it was 1080p. Phone feels laggy with some apps in the background and app switching simply relaunches the app a little slower than it initially launched, RAM is the issue there, 4gb is simply not enough but it makes sense in terms of the price. One thing I really don‚Äôt like is the camera UI, it‚Äôs super laggy and switching between camera modes is long enough that you feel yourself growing old. It‚Äôs abysmal, i hope it can be fixed with a software update. Processor clearly shows it‚Äôs shortcomings in situations like these.Thoughts-Overall the G21 is a great buy as a second phone if you don‚Äôt wanna splurge on a secondary device. Do not expect any thing great in terms of performance but if you wanna buy this simply as a phone with some light content watching and your usual social media consumption, it‚Äôs great. My nitpickings are from as a power user, but it‚Äôs wrong of me to expect too much from a budget-midrange phone. It‚Äôs a good back up phone for anyone looking to buy one!Cheersüçª",5.0 out of 5 stars
1003,"As soon as I bought this phone, I realised there were a few functions missing. I thought the problems will be corrected in subsequent updates, but now at least than a year I have already forgotten what basic functions I wanted. Then at around 6 months time, the front camera stopped working and I thought maybe it was my mistake or my daughter may have changed some settings that I am not able to reverse. Now it is less than a year from buying this phone and the battery has swollen and my phone is switching off within an hour almost. I went to the authorised repair for Nokia (by the way, there are only 3 such authorised dealers in Pune, which has become the biggest city in Maharashtra now). I went there and there was nobody at the reception desk to talk to a customer. After waiting 15 minutes I called ""koi hai?"" and one person attended me. I asked him to check if there was a problem with my charger or the battery and he said it will be Rs 350 only to check. I asked why? He said they will need to call for a spare battery. I, being a woman with no technical knowledge, told him that he could check if the battery was swollen or he could plug the phone to another charger to check if the phone was recharging any faster and that he need not take 3 days to just check where the problem lies and no need to spend 350 either. He became silent at this answer. Then he said I will need to leave the phone with him for at least a day for him to check it and that I will need to fill a form. I said ""nobody asked me to fill a form when buying the phone, and you need a whole day just to see if the battery is swollen or the charger has a problem?"" Even govt departments have started working faster than them. That same morning I had gone to a govt department and got resolution within 2 hours. And yet, I thought 2 hours wait was too long. And here, a pvt company's customer service is taking a while day just to see if the battery is swollen?? I don't have a trained eye and 2 days after, even I can tell that the battery is swollen.Question is, why did the battery die within a year? Even duplicate batteries work longer than that.",1.0 out of 5 stars

With the side thumb print unlock very accessible and also easy to identify with its lower placement, it is easy to lock and unlock the phone quicklyThe screen is a delight to view and though the tear drop design is dated it is less intrusive to the viewing angles than the iphone notch or the pill on other phonesThe battery life is stupendous.

This phone I bought before the Amazon GIF 2022 was not our first choice but after getting it we are so pleased as it meets all the criteria.Aesthetics (7/10): In this price segment this phone looks quite great and elegant with a minimalistic design.Processing works (8/10): With 4 GB ram and a Mali-G57 MP1 processor, it runs smoothly. So far, no lag has been witnessed and apps stay in the background without closing.The call quality (8/10): The calling and answering are also great as the sound of the caller can be heard with clarity.Battery (8/10): With moderate to heavy usage i.e., watching videos all day long it requires charging once a day. With the Li-Po 5050 mAh, the battery does not heat up and is also not during running apps and multitasking.Display (7/10): The best quality is the display of the phone; it is not a typical IPS, unlike other devices in this range it gives a way better viewing experience and the elements are sharp. 90Hz display is enjoyable and 400nits is enough for any use unless one is a photographer or gamer.Android (10/10): Extremely satisfied with the android one experience. Way smoother than expected as the device has only 4 GB of ram.Camera (7/10): Although it provides a sufficiently good camera, the images are not so great (you will not find any great camera in this price range in any other Chinese brands). In daylight, it is able to take decent pictures with enough details.Resolution (6/10): Once getting used to it for 2 to 3 days no one would notice the significant difference between 720x1200 and higher. But nowadays full HD has become a minimum requirement.In conclusion, I am fully satisfied with the purchase given the price I have paid for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I will be writing this review based on my personal experience and will write about the things that I like and I don't about this device.Things that I liked:i) I really like the battery life. When I recieved the phone it was charged around 50 percent so, I plugged it in and charged to 100%. After that I haven't charged the phone yet, and after two and a half days of medium to heavy uses which includes a few hours of gaming and a few more of streaming on Youtube and Netflix, I still have 34% left right now. This is a big upgrade for me.ii) Camera quality is decent for a phone of this range, It wouldn't come close to a Professional camera, but is more than enough for your everyday selfies and some light amateur photography.iii)The phone comes with a cover, so no worrying about scratches in the first few days of uses.iv)The screen is very responsive and will handle your day to day online gaming without any issues.Suggestionsi) The screen is a little too large a slightly smaller screen would have been much better.ii) The power adapter is only 10 watts. My older Nokia 7.1 came with a 17 watts charger and since this phone ships with a larger battery capacity, the power adapter should be a little more powerful.This my opinion based on my use case. I would definetly suggest this phone for those who need a powerful battery and do medium to heavy gaming.Also I have clicked some pictures which I am attaching with this review.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Body looks good. Performance is also good, at the beginning it was snappy, but now a little less reponsive after about 15 days of usage - still good. Android version is 11, not sure if there is gonna be 12 or 13, though.Overall a good budget phone buy - especially if you want a long lasting battery",4.0 out of 5 stars
1031,Bought this phone for the clean android and guaranteed updates. It‚Äôs been 3months now and it‚Äôs working just perfect. It does what I need it to do.

[URGENT MESSAGE]Overall experience is better, no lagging, best usage in office use and general purposes, I would suggest though, go with the 6gb RAM and 128gb Internal Storage expandable memory upto 512gb varient. camera quality is decent but the most noticeable is the battery backup which is phenomenal. But there is a reason to giving it 3 stars. Whenever you buy, there will be a sticker attach to the package saying that you have to give 5 stars and write a great review in amazon and take a screen shot and post it to Nokia's official site to get Brand new Nokia Earphones(Which is a gimmick). It is a total mar letting strategy. And I would like to add that it's speaker sound is not going to be satisfying. So buy with caution and checking your requirements.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I was also looking for a screen size of 5.5 inc but could not find one and had to finally settle with this phone after lots of contemplation. The phone comes with plain vanilla install of Android One OS and is not attached with any defacto spam apps or games. The box package comes with a nice back cover, which is again a pocket saver.

G21 seems to be a bit on the heavy side (weight wise) which makes it difficult for senior citizens.

I am told by the company that they have free pick up and drop Service. The number of service centers are limited, nevertheless the call center did a good job by explaining in detail about their service. By the way I checked this before buying the phone and asked them quite frankly their thought on my buying Nokia G21. They were good with their responseSoftware - Free security and OS update promised for next 3 yearsAudio & Video - Quite good I must say!Overall - 4/5 based on my knowledgeI certainly would recommend this phone especially if you are someone whose priority is to have no clutter, long battery life and who chooses the phone & it's apps to be own choice.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1050,"First of all it boggles me to see that the market is just swamped with the chinese phone brands, more than I can count on my fingers. As I never intend to buy any such brand, the options were limited. Nokia has been pushing out some good products recently.The main things I like about this is1. Clean UI, minimal OEM customizations.2. Minimal bloatware, there were 2-3 apps installed as part of the first time setup process, but these can be quickly uninstalled.3. Guest mode, this might not be relevant to most users, but it is important if one wants to compartmentalize some of their activities/usage on phone, by signing up as another user(s). This feature was lacking (to my amazement) in some of other brands' flagships.4. Battery seems to be lasting well, a good 2 days or more with light usage (no gaming but web surfing, calls, chatting,But for me, trust in a brand has always been highly important. That is why I have never bought a chinese brand. What is ironic, is that the old Nokia, HTC and LG, the clean players (for the most part) closed their shops. :-)Think about if you can really trust your phone.

1060,"I recently purchased the Realme Narzo 50i Prime in Dark Blue with 4GB RAM and 64GB Storage. While it has its strengths, it also falls short in some key areas.Pros:1. **Affordable Price**: The Realme Narzo 50i Prime is a budget-friendly phone, making it accessible for those looking for an affordable smartphone.2. **Decent Battery Life**: The 5000 mAh battery is one of the phone's standout features. It provides a good amount of juice to last through a day of moderate use.3. **Smooth Performance**: The octa-core processor handles everyday tasks and apps reasonably well, ensuring smooth operation for the most part.Cons:1. **Display Quality**: The display leaves much to be desired. Colors appear washed out, and the resolution is not sharp. It's a significant drawback, especially for media consumption.2. **Camera Performance**: The camera setup on this phone is rather basic. While it can capture decent photos in well-lit conditions, low-light photography is disappointing, and there's a noticeable lack of detail in images.3. **Limited RAM**: With only 4GB of RAM, the phone struggles with multitasking, and apps tend to reload frequently. This can be frustrating for users who like to switch between apps quickly.4. **Bloatware**: The Realme Narzo 50i Prime comes with a fair amount of pre-installed bloatware, which can be annoying. You'll need to spend some time uninstalling or disabling unnecessary apps.5. **Build Quality**: The phone feels a bit plasticky and not as sturdy as some of its competitors in the same price range.Overall, the Realme Narzo 50i Prime is an okay budget phone. If you're on a tight budget and prioritize battery life and basic functionality over display quality and camera performance, it might be worth considering. However, if you can stretch your budget a bit, there are better options available in the market that offer a more well-rounded smartphone experience.",3.0 out of 5 stars

No Screen Guard / Tampered Glass on the phone screen. No Plascic Back Cover is there also, which really needed. The company can add hardware also for 'Fingerprint Sensor', this is the disadvantage of the phone, as the fingerpriint sensor is much more secured than the pass lock or face lock. Another thing you can't change the icon shaping, By default it is round, which I hate round shape icons on phone. I'm using Oneplus Nord 2T also, which has the features in software. Not comparing this Narzo with One plus, but they could provide this. Camera quality is so so. Now-a-days normal phone dialer is getting replaced by Google dialer, which has the call recording option, but in this case both of the parties can hear that their calls are getting recorded. They could bypass like Samsung, as Samsung has their own dialer with call recording facility.After one day of using it returned it to Amazon.

This phone is not for graphic intensive games. But Okay for subway surfer , temple run games kind of games .Issues :I am waiting for UI updates to fix landscape screen crashing. And Also Google play doesn't load up sometimes- need to reset or clear cache .Charging takes 2hrs nearly- I end up charging twice a day.Speaker felt weird for few days- then I got adapted to it.I have mic issues when taking call in speaker mode.Final verdict :If looking for basic phone with 5g processor - UI needs bug fixes though - buy it if you know what you are signing up.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The hardware specs are neat.So far, I haven't had a good time with the camera. The pictures often come out blurry, which means that autofocus isn't very quick. Redmi's older note phones have better cameras.My biggest disappointment with this phone is the UI. MIUI is a terrible OS if you're into customization and other things. Firstly, don't expect a lot of features that were offered. Xiaomi locks many of the MIUI features for China only, but also locks them out of lower-end devices like this. Secondly, they have disabled full-screen gestures if you're using a custom launcher. The default MIUI launcher is terrible as well and just doesn't look good. For an individual who is accustomed to the stock Android experience, the MIUI 14 has been a dismal experience after almost 20 days of using the phone.I really want to give the phone a higher rating, but the software is preventing me from doing so.

1144,Snapdragon 4 gen 2 perform very well in all condition. I used to play COD where I feels no lag at all using game booster it achieves 60 fps.Battery gives u a day and more with normal usage. But if we play games we have to charge at the end of day. Phone build is solid even it gives u plastic back..Cons:-Battery charging is low as it comes with 18watts charging.Camera is not upto the mark I use third party camera app which perform little bit ok.I recommend this phone if want only performance phone in low budget..

1146,I like the colour and the price of the phone so much as it is a budget phone . But they showed that the ram is expandable upto 16 GB but it doesn't work as like a 16Gb ram it is only for showing that this has 16 GB Ram. The storage they have provided is good and they can provide a good processor even faster . The sensor are very fast ....can add upto 3-4 faces for face unlock and many more customisation.

1200,"As a retired (70s) person I needed a phone for Calling, Messaging, Entertainment, Browsing and Chrome casting. This phone is OK. But the weight of the phone gives pain in my fingers. Using Jio Router for WiFi. Although phone has dual band Wi-Fi capability, 2.4GHZ only gave a speed of 22 while 5GHZ gave full 30mbps. My old Realme phone only single band gives full 30 at the same spot. But overall it is still value for money for hard pressed oldies like me. On 22nd July, after 3 days of purchase I was pleased to receive MIUI 14 which is Android 13. Tested all features of Android 13 and so far no problems.I am writing again after 3 days of using MIUI 14 ie Android 13. Suddenly after 2 days my apps are behaving strangely. Calculator has no numeric pad, Battery Icon doesn't show %, drop down Status bar tray is showing only few icons. Immediately took it to MI service centre and new software was installed in 45 mts. and phone seems to work well with Android 13. Keeping fingers crossed. I have now visited MI Service Centre 3 times since my device was purchased on 19th July and still crashing. I hope MI will take up the matter seriously and not do a shoddy warranty job. I have not at all used the phone even for a single day.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1202,"Here is my honest review of the Redmi 12C smartphone:Pros:Good performance - The MediaTek Helio G85 processor and 4GB RAM provide smooth performance for day-to-day tasks and light gaming.Large display - It has a 6.71-inch HD+ display which is nice for watching videos and gaming. The teardrop notch is unobtrusive.Excellent battery life - With a large 5000mAh battery, the 12C can easily last 1.5-2 days of use on a single charge. Standby time is fantastic.Decent cameras - The 13MP rear and 5MP front cameras capture decent shots in good lighting conditions. The AI camera features are nice to have.Affordable price - Starting at just Rs. 8,999, the 12C offers good value considering the large display, battery and performance.Cons:Dated design - The thick bezels and plastic body make it look outdated compared to competitors. Build quality could be better.Average low-light photography - The cameras struggle in low light situations with visible noise. No ultra-wide or macro lens.Only 18W charging - Charging the large 5000mAh battery is slow with the included 18W charger. No support for faster charging.HD display - The display has only HD+ resolution (1600 x 720 pixels) resulting in less sharpness compared to Full HD displays.Overall, the Redmi 12C is a decent affordable smartphone for basic use and light gaming. It excels in battery life but has an outdated design and average camera performance. For the price, it's a good option for budget buyers who prioritize battery life and core performance. But those wanting better design or cameras can consider other options.",3.0 out of 5 stars
1203,"Camera does have 50 megapixel but you will get only portrait, normal, night, HDR and time lapse modes. I think night mode can be better.It is quite easy to use and is quite a sturdy one.It doesn't heat much but it can if you play high quality games which requires more functions like PUBG.Charging comes with normal one, there is no c type port and it takes its time to charge, no supercharge function.Appearance wise it's one of the best, you get great colour options and purple looks really good.I think this is a good budget phone.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1204,"Good built quality and appearance.Dislikes -many basic features that are only software related are also dropped for no reason.No new control center.Camera app don't have panorama, slow motion, document, AI modes. They are all software related not hardware which doesn't cost anything.Same way gallery editor is restricted of many common features like auto adjust image, colour focus filters etc.Auto brightness has some difficulty in adjustment.No live wallpaper,no always on display.Home screen grid is limited to only 4x4 and 5x5 in such a big screen. It should be atleast upto 5X7 option.No option to pin window or floating window, or split screen app option from recent menu.Hardware side -IR blaster, gyroscope sensor for compass, proximity sensor are missing for cost cutting.Type C charging port also dropped which is unbelievable.Extreme thick bazels and big lower space is just increased the size of phone.The weight is more than expected and size is also very big (even bigger than my redmi note 10 pro). God knows the reason behind making such bulky oversize phones. You cannot find any smaller size phone in the market.Screen quality, sound quality, camera quality are acceptable at this price range. No issue faced.Fingerprint sensor is at very high position, difficult to reach, and frequently you will touch camera lens instead of FP sensor because of the placement.Conclusion:On overall, it's basically a good hardware side purchase at this price range with very basic features (especially for elders and family members. But again too bulky for elders).On software side complete disappointment from MIUI for removing very basic features from its applications for no good reason.",3.0 out of 5 stars

1206,"I recently had the chance to explore the Redmi 12C in Matte Black, and my experience has been a combination of both positive and not-so-positive aspects. Here's a detailed breakdown:Pros:High-Performance Processor: The inclusion of the Mediatek Helio G85 processor brings a noticeable boost in performance, ensuring smoother multitasking and responsiveness.Excellent Battery Life: The battery life on the Redmi 12C is certainly a standout feature. It holds up impressively even during extended use, reducing the need for frequent charges.Cons:Display Performance: While the display is good overall, it falls short of being exceptional. Colors and clarity are satisfactory, but I expected a bit more vibrancy and sharpness.Sound Quality: Unfortunately, the sound quality did not meet my expectations. The audio output lacks the depth and richness I anticipated, which can impact the overall multimedia experience.MIUI OS: The MIUI operating system brings its own set of challenges. The user experience could be smoother, and certain functionalities, such as the contact search not showing recently added contacts and a delay in recent call history list updates, have been noticeable issues.Camera Performance: The camera's performance is average, offering acceptable results but not quite meeting the high standards set by other devices in this category.The Redmi 12C brings a mix of features to the table, with some aspects that shine and others that leave room for improvement. The high-performance processor and remarkable battery life are commendable, providing an enhanced user experience. However, areas like display vibrancy, sound quality, and the MIUI OS experience could use further refinement. While the camera captures moments adequately, it doesn't deliver exceptional results. For those seeking a budget-friendly option with a balance of strengths and weaknesses, the Redmi 12C could be considered. Keep in mind the trade-offs and decide based on your priorities.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1350,"Here is my review of the iPhone 14 Pro Max after using it for a couple of weeks:The iPhone 14 Pro Max is the most advanced and powerful smartphone that Apple has made. It offers a stunning design, a superb display, a pro-level camera system, and a blazing-fast performance. It is not a cheap device, but it is worth every penny if you are looking for the best of the best.Design: The iPhone 14 Pro Max has a sleek and elegant design that feels premium in the hand. It has a flat 6.7-inch OLED display that covers almost the entire front of the device, with a pill-shaped notch at the top that houses the Face ID sensors and the selfie camera. The back of the device is made of textured matt glass that resists fingerprints and scratches, and the frame is made of stainless steel that adds durability and shine. The device comes in four beautiful colors: Space Black, Silver, Gold, and Deep Purple. The iPhone 14 Pro Max also has an IP68 rating, which means it can withstand water up to 6 meters deep for up to 30 minutes.Display: The display of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is one of its main highlights. It features a Super Retina XDR OLED display with a resolution of 2796x1290 pixels and a pixel density of 460 ppi. The display supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision, which means it can deliver stunning colors and contrast for watching videos and playing games. The display also has a refresh rate of 120Hz, which makes everything look smoother and more responsive. The display uses ProMotion technology, which adapts the refresh rate to the content on the screen, saving battery life and improving performance. The display also has an Always-On feature, which shows your personalized lock screen with your favorite widgets without having to tap the screen.Camera: The camera system of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is another major selling point. It features a quad-camera setup on the rear, consisting of a 48MP main camera, a 12MP ultra-wide camera, a 12MP 2x telephoto camera, and a 12MP 3x telephoto camera. The main camera has a quad-pixel sensor that can capture more detail and light in every shot. It also has a second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization, which reduces blur and shake in low-light conditions. The ultra-wide camera has a 120-degree field of view, which lets you capture more scenery and perspective in your photos. The telephoto cameras have optical-quality zoom, which lets you get closer to your subject without losing quality. The camera system also supports Night mode, Portrait mode, Panorama mode, Macro mode, Photographic Styles, and Smart HDR 4, which enhance your photos with advanced algorithms and effects. The camera system also supports Cinematic mode, which lets you shoot professional-looking videos in 4K HDR at 24 fps with depth-of-field control. You can also edit your videos in ProRes or Dolby Vision HDR formats on your device or on your Mac.Performance: The iPhone 14 Pro Max is powered by the A16 Bionic chip, which is the most powerful processor that Apple has ever created. It has a 6-core CPU, a 5-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine, which work together to deliver fast and smooth performance for any task. The A16 Bionic chip can handle demanding workloads such as gaming, video editing, augmented reality, machine learning, and more with ease. It also has a power-efficient design, which allows it to run at high speeds for longer without draining the battery.Battery: The battery life of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is impressive as well. It has a large 4,400 mAh battery that can last up to 29 hours of video playback or up to 23 hours of video streaming on a single charge. It also supports fast charging with a USB-C to Lightning cable or a MagSafe charger, which can charge up to 50% in just 30 minutes. It also supports wireless charging with any Qi-compatible charger or accessory.Overall experience: The iPhone 14 Pro Max is an amazing device that offers everything you could ask for in a smartphone. It has a gorgeous design, a brilliant display, a fantastic camera system, and an incredible performance. It is easy to use and secure with iOS 16, which offers many new features and improvements such as Dynamic Island, Action mode, FaceTime SharePlay, Live Text, Focus, Safari redesign, and more. It also works seamlessly with other Apple devices and services such as AirPods, Apple Watch, iCloud, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and more.The iPhone 14 Pro Max is not for everyone though. It is a very large and heavy device, which may not be comfortable for some people to hold or carry. It is also very expensive, starting at ‚Çπ1,29,900 for the 128GB model and going up to ‚Çπ1,69,900 for the 1TB model. It also does not have a headphone jack, a microSD card slot, or a fingerprint scanner, which may be deal-breakers for some users.However, if you are looking for the ultimate smartphone experience and you don't mind the size, the price, or the lack of some features, then the iPhone 14 Pro Max is the perfect choice for you. It is a device that will impress you with its design, display, camera, and performance. It is a device that will make you feel like a pro.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1351,"Apple hasn‚Äôt made any bones about the fact that there are certain products it has that aren‚Äôt meant for everyone. Some of these ‚Äî like the Mac Studio or even the Mac mini ‚Äî are way too niche and will be sought by those who really need them. And then there are those that bring the best of Apple at an expensive ‚Äî very expensive ‚Äî price point but are desired by many. The iPhone‚Äôs Pro models have always been in the category ‚Äî the coveted one, the desirable one, the one that makes you want to junk that financial prudence that has been drilled in you. The iPhone 14 Pro Max is very much that phone ‚Äî the best of Apple and by now you know that it is an expensive phone. Rs 1,39,900 is the starting price and there‚Äôs little point in debating on why it‚Äôs so expensive and whether it‚Äôs value for money or not. It‚Äôs an Apple product, it is an iPhone, and it is the Pro Max variant ‚Äî of course it will be expensive. Apple wants your money and the iPhone 14 Pro Max is that dangling proposition that may just want you to break the bank and get one.DESIGN AND DISPLAYSeen one? Seen all. If you have seen the iPhone 12 Pro Max or the iPhone 13 Pro Max then the iPhone 14 Pro Max has very little different to offer in terms of design. It‚Äôs a popular design with a stainless frame that looks elegant and the frosted glass back is still gorgeous to look at. Apple knows that this design is a hit and there‚Äôs no point in expecting it to change anytime soon. Generally, an Apple design lasts for years before a new one comes. Don‚Äôt believe us? Look at the MacBook Air, which followed a similar design philosophy for years till the M2 model arrived this year. So don‚Äôt expect Apple to make wholesale changes to the design every year, you will only get disappointed.The one remarkable thing about the design of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is that yes, you have seen it before and yes, it hasn‚Äôt changed but it still looks great. But do keep in mind that this is a really big phone. If you aren‚Äôt used to a big phone then perhaps think twice before getting this or look at the iPhone 14 Pro instead. I wouldn‚Äôt call it unwieldy but yes, it is certainly not a one-handed phone. The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra felt really big but this one feels rather bigger in the hand. And yes, it is heavy as well at 240 grams.The big size is preferred by many as it brings in a big display and it‚Äôs a compromise many would settle for on the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The 6.7-inch OLED display offers a resolution of 2796 x 1290 pixel and 460ppi pixel density. What‚Äôs that in common parlance? An excellent display that is great to look at, colour reproduction is accurate and the brightness levels are optimum. Apple claims that the iPhone 14 Pro Max offers the maximum brightness in a smartphone ‚Äî 2000 nits of brightness in direct sunlight. We had zero problems reading on the iPhone 14 Pro Max even when it was really sunny outside.The 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate works as smoothly as it did on the iPhone 13 Pro Max ‚Äî no complaints or no changes here to see. The display is extremely snappy and a lot of it is down to iOS 16 as well as Apple does handle animations much better than most of its competition does.If the refresh rate and other specs remain the same, then there‚Äôs something new in the form of the Always-on display. Better late than never, some may say. Apple is fashionably late but has arrived in some style. Now I am sure you must have read that some Android phone brought Always-on display first. Heck, even Google couldn‚Äôt resist the temptation to take a dig at Apple during its biggest hardware event of 2022. But Apple has created a perception that it isn‚Äôt in the rat race and that some features might not come first but they do come with a difference. Like the Always-on display.Apple‚Äôs implementation of Always-on display is unlike any other smartphone. What happens on the iPhone 14 Pro Max when Always-on display is turned on is that the lock screen is dimmed. ‚ÄúDisplay, display on the phone, who‚Äôs the prettiest of ‚Äòem all?‚Äù It‚Äôs the iPhone 14 Pro Max with the Always-on display. You can see notifications, lock screen widgets and everything else but it is subtly dimmed. If you have an iPhone and you use it for the first time, you might feel that was there a need for this? Not really but once you‚Äôve used it, I bet you will not be able to use the iPhone 14 Pro Max without toggling on the Always-on display.DYNAMIC ISLANDNow generally we tend to keep all display features in one sub-head but we are making an exception for the Dynamic Island. After all it is the belle of the ball, the headline act of the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Or at least it‚Äôs the most-talked about feature on this year‚Äôs iPhones. And it does deserve a separate section as it is delightfully done. The notch was Apple‚Äôs gift to the smartphone industry. The first year after the launch of iPhone X ‚Äî the first one with the notch ‚Äî Android brands made a beeline to adopt the notch as if Santa Claus handed it out on Christmas. But then Android phone makers came up with their really good iterations of it and Apple stuck with the notch until the Dynamic Island arrived with the iPhone 14 Pro models. And man, it is so well done that you just keep fiddling with it only for the first few days ‚Äî at least that‚Äôs what I found myself doing. The Dynamic Island is a different take on the notch and makes the use of that space which no one else ever thought of doing it before Apple. Not a fan of the name but this is a really cool feature to use and is not gimmicky at all.For someone who uses Apple Music a lot more than one should, the Dynamic Island is a treat. It will show the album artwork along the playback controls, and the waveform, AirPlay ‚Äî all in that tiny little space. If you are using any app and get an incoming call, then the Dynamic Island will show the alert and all the call controls. AirPods Pro‚Äôs battery life also appears in the Dynamic Island. Apple Maps directions also come on the Dynamic Island and so much so that at times I did ditch Google Maps for it because it looks really good.Apple has always had a way of showing all these notifications but never had a ‚Äòhome‚Äô ‚Äî which is now the Dynamic Island. In a few months, here‚Äôs hoping that other developers take advantage of the Dynamic Island as it is a really fun and useful feature. Apple is expected to launch Live Activities API soon and that‚Äôs when we will really see the Dynamic Island thrive and it is something that should get a lot of people excited. Is the feature good enough to pay the difference between the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro price? It certainly is if you want the complete iPhone experience.CAMERAIt has been well established that the iPhone cameras are one of the most consistent and versatile ones around. Apple seemed mightily reluctant to get in the megapixel race and remained steady with 12MP cameras. A case of better late than never yet again and once more Apple has done it differently. The primary camera now has a 48MP sensor, which produces some excellent images. All the images clicked from the 48MP camera have rich colours and look exceptionally vibrant and true to life. There are a lot of details captured especially in the images which were clicked using ProRAW. Like every other 48MP camera, Apple too uses pixel binning to give you 12MP images only but the ProRAW mode actually gives you 48MP images. And the difference is quite stark as more details are captured. But the trade-off is that images clicked with the 48MP camera consume a lot of space, like a lot. The photos we clicked ranged anywhere between 12MB to 42MB ‚Äî so use it rather judiciously. Of course, ProRAW is meant not just for utilising the 48MP camera.What works in the favour of the primary 48MP camera ‚Äî with and without pixel binning ‚Äî is the consistency it offers. You can be clicking in good lighting condition or not-so-good conditions, the iPhone 14 Pro Max delivers images that make you sit up and take note. Apple has certainly improved low-light photography as the iPhone 14 Pro Max does a wonderful job when the lights are dimmed. What the 48MP primary camera also gives is the option of 2x optical zoom lens ‚Äî a nice addition to the iPhone 14 Pro Max‚Äôs camera‚Äôs arsenal.The other 12MP cameras ‚Äî telephoto and ultra-wide ‚Äî also do a fine job of clicking images. Portraits clicked on the iPhone 14 Pro Max look great and bokeh effect is spot on. Apple‚Äôs computational photography has been a step ahead of others and on the iPhone 14 Pro Max you get the Photonic Engine. As per Apple, this is meant to improve colour reproduction and click better images in less light.The lack of zoom on the telephoto camera now does rankle a bit. The iPhone 14 Pro Max offers 3x zoom at a time when the likes of Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra can go up to 100x. I do wish Apple brings more zoom capabilities on the next iPhone as it is perhaps the only feature that is missing on these cameras.The Macro mode ‚Äî enabled automatically ‚Äî is a true delight on the iPhone 14 Pro Max. No one has done a better job with the macro mode than Apple as the results are truly excellent. Try capturing fabrics with the iPhone 14 Pro Max and the level of details is fascinating to see. You will find macro modes in so many smartphones‚Äô cameras but the iPhone 14 Pro Max is a cut above the rest.For the selfie/usfie/groupfie/whateverfie brigade, Apple has added a brand new camera. The 12MP camera now gets autofocus and it is really impressive. And it really shows in FaceTime calls or other video calls as well. There‚Äôs more clarity than there ever was on any iPhone. The front camera is a significant improvement on the iPhone 14 Pro Max.Where the iPhone 14 Pro Max‚Äôs camera really shines is videos. Apple brought Cinematic Mode last year with the iPhone 13 Pros and with the iPhone 14 Pros, you get the all-new Action Mode. No, it‚Äôs not a gimbal or anything like that. What it does is it really it offers really good stabilisation and that‚Äôs because Apple has improved EIS (electronic image stabilisation). You don‚Äôt get 4K recording with this mode as maximum resolution offered is 2.8K but it is still very good. The footage almost always remained really stable. The Cinematic Mode still remains great fun to use.Is this the best camera setup in any smartphone? Not exactly but it is certainly most versatile and consistent cameras in any smartphone. Almost every image is pleasing to look at and more than anything, the iPhone 14 Pro Max makes you want to click more images ‚Äî something that I can‚Äôt say about any other smartphone, except the Pixel phones.PERFORMANCE, BATTERY LIFEThis will be rather short and concise: the A-series Bionic processors on the iPhones have always been blazing fast and the iPhone 14 Pro Max with A16 is no different. The phone is a total powerhouse in every sense and handles all sorts of tasks comically well. You really can‚Äôt find any fault in the performance of the iPhone 14 Pro Max as it really is flawless. The iOS 16 experience is still getting refined so you might see a bug here and there but I expect Apple to sort that out soon.The iPhone 13 Pro Max by far had the best battery performance I have seen in all the phones reviewed in the last 12 months. Expectations were lofty from the iPhone 14 Pro Max and it was a rather bumpy start. In the first few days, with just under 5 hours of screen time, the phone had consumed close to 84% battery ‚Äî alarm bells did ring as Apple did tout the battery life of the iPhone 14 Pro Max. However after a few days normalcy was resumed as with six hours of screen time ‚Äî with Always-on enabled ‚Äî the iPhone 14 Pro Max still had 40% battery left. Does the Always-on display consume a lot of battery?Slightly but it‚Äôs not a battery guzzling feature. Overall, with a lot of streaming on Apple Music, Safari, WhatsApp, social media activities on a daily basis, the iPhone 14 Pro Max can really go on for a day ‚Äî and then some ‚Äî on a single charge.VERDICTApple has made a habit of making excellent smartphones and the iPhone 14 Pro Max is no different. There‚Äôs no escaping the fact that the iPhone 14 Pro Max is one of the most expensive smartphones you can buy ‚Äî starting at Rs 1,39,900 and goes up to Rs 1,89,900 (1TB storage variant). You might think that it will be a hard sell especially in a country like India. India still remains a vanilla iPhone island but the aspiration to go Pro is strong as ever.This year Apple has really separated the Pro models from the vanilla ones with the iPhone 14 series. And there is still an audience that salivates at the thought of getting an iPhone Pro ‚Äî perhaps they have used the vanilla and want an upgrade or they are the ones that just want the best of Apple. The iPhone 14 Pro Max gets the best of Apple in every sense. The display is a delight ‚Äî Dynamic Island is great fun ‚Äî and the cameras have been upgraded as well. Should you go for it? Without battling an eyelid as long as you can splash the cash The iPhone 14 Pro Max is one of the best smartphones money can buy.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Won‚Äôt bore you all with the geeky details which can be easily found on the web. All I can say the interface is way too smooth and the dynamic island is a funky lil feature that I love the most about this phone. The always on display is creatively done, stands out in the crowd, ppl instantly know which phone you‚Äôre carrying. Plus when the album art of Apple Music that stays in the AOD is a lovely lil touch. All in all if you can afford it, go for it. Believe me you‚Äôll not regret it, it is miles better than iPhone 12 and 13. The Pro models of iPhone 14 are definitely worth it.

I've had a few Pixel, OnePlus and Samsung phones in the past, but nothing feels as premium as this.Move to iOS - For me, the Android to iOS movement was pretty smooth. Managed to transfer around 400 contacts, 3000 Messages, 15GB of whatsapp data (Your mileage may vary)Camera - No regrets here. Every shot that you take might be one of the best shots any phone camera can take.Cons -Expensive - Considering the price wasn't changed in U.S., it's still a very expensive phoneAvailability - A bit harder to get right now (My brother still struggling with his pre-order from Amazon)",5.0 out of 5 stars

1387," (Pre-ordered on 10th of September, package received today i.e 24th of September). I was already using iPhone 13 Pro Max from past 11 months and had say it is still the best value for money iPhone you can buy this time, at least in India considering huge price jump from previous models. I only purchased iPhone 14 Pro Max just because of ‚ÄúDynamic Island‚Äù and tbh i literally got bored after few minutes of using and experimenting with it. Well definitely it‚Äôs a fresh design but is it really worth paying almost 40K extra for that new notch? I would say go with 13 pro/max and save your money. Also I am surprised that this iphone is so demanding this year, if you have already planned to buy 14 pro/max then you have to wait for a month or so‚Ä¶it is literally out of stock from everywhere.

1400,"About the phoneApple phone without a second delay, I would say it is better than all android phones I have used. The phone is like water, it flows in a way you want and shaping in your way. In a best way possible, the phone is designed to only show what the user wants and eliminating unnecessary ads, features that I have seen in android.Why it is better than Android?You pay too much money for Apple products, obviously you experience the features, physical components , camera lens etc. Apart from basic things, you can also enjoy the best applications available in app store. If you are a developer you might know the app store policy for application publish and their security posture towards handling payment apps etc. They publish best application and the way the apps, its modules switches is just flawless. Due to the so called strict policy of privacy program with Apple products, iPhone can pop up a box in your screen if any apps wants to track your activity with other applications. +1 respect for apple to show such concern with user.Apple phones are same ? like 13 vs 14The reason 14 is same as 13 may be business practice followed from 11th edition. But please note that iPhone making changes internally like physical components (small change in battery performance, lens in 14 edition), additional features but that may not satisfy you to buy 14 edition. If you do not find ""the very few changes"" interesting in 14, go for 13. Because physical and even cameras are not visually very much different in 13 vs 14 comparison. Also you get 13 for cheap :)14 is just added features but that is not for daily use, the features real time use is rare case. But the best part is there is no extra cost between 13 vs 14 prices (except extra 10k slash)Concern you must have.Apple is not giving chargers and their silicon cases are very expensive (but very good in touch and scratch friendly in back due to silk layer). This is an issue for sure. You have to buy charger not coming with USB C and claiming that you help carbon footprint, understandable but not customer friendly business model. Even after the purchase I had to spend at least 7k for charger and case.Apple care.I am not buying it, I pay for phone which is already expensive for this premium and apple care does have strict policy that if you understand that is waste. Instead I find a private insurance to make things better.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1403,"It is just a review from my side so that its good for you to know before buying rather than regretting later.Positives:* Showoff* Camera* Sound* Security (they say, bt that blocks so many accessibility options for me)* So many awesome features as all iphone users say (which probably I will use once in a lifetime)Negatives for me (You may like it):1. No shortcut to change between vibration and no vibration frequently.2. No end call button on the lock screen.3. Call list is nonsense. It shows phone, whatsap and all other calls in same list.4. Go to a specific contact in call history n you can see only history of one day. Total length of call history is 100. Most probably you will not be able to find call history of previous week for a specific contact.5. Need of Itunes to copy music from PC to phone.6. No file manager like android where we can see and access complete folder structure.7. No silent and vibrate mode notification on screen.8. Need to buy separate adapter n earphones after already spending double.9. Cannot remove torch icon in iphone14 from lock screen. You may end up switching it on unwillingly.10. BT and WiFi shortcuts will just disconnect them. To turn off you need to go to Settings screen and turn it off again.11. In so many places, either text or files, there is no Select All option. (I'm waiting for android users to get all pics received in whatsapp after a trip).12. Takes a lot of time to get detected by devices when hotspot is on.13. At some screen you get stuck and you will miss the back button.14. Copy some mp3 files to your iphone and you will never be able to find it with default music app.15. Every app will be either on lot of home screens or organised under some groups. You will never get a clean home screen with 2 or 3 most frequently used apps and all other apps in a swipe up menu like android.16. No fingerprint sensor.Adding to the list after using for 2 months:17. Cannot turn off camera shutter sound in general mode.18. No option to flag contact as spam/scam.19. If you connect wireless BT device, it won't show battery percentage of BT device.20. You get a notification while using phone and you miss to open it, then you will not see it until you remember yourself to open notification screen. Notification icons won't be pinned on top of the screen like Android.21. If you use 2 SIM and want to switch mobile data between SIMs, there is no shortcut than going to Settings screen. Also, cannot see current amount of data used or left.List goes on and on, try it yourself.. No iphone owner speaks about limitations. Some people like iphone for these and others hate it for these. If you can pay double and handle these adjustments with work arounds, go ahead. Once you unlock and give your phone to someone, or once you give access permissions to apps, even iphone is not most secure. Fr example, If you are driving and someone wants to use your phone for music/maps etc., then you have to give your password, because there is no fingerprint option and face recogniton feature will become dangerous option.",3.0 out of 5 stars

1422,"The Apple iPhone 14 is overall a great phone for anyone who is looking for high speed, excellent camera quality, and a day-long of battery life. The squared-off sides are more comfortable to hold in your hand in my opinion. I purchased this one and so far my experience has been wonderful. Something I like about this phone is its fast speed along with the different options the camera gives you. I wouldn't say the iPhone 14 has a better camera than the 13, rather I think they are more similar and there wasn't a dramatic improvement. The battery life is something that I wish was a little longer. It last about an hour or two more than the average iPhone 13, but does charge faster. I have been able to receive about a 50% charge in 30 minutes. Another great feature of this phone is the painless eSIM setup. Being able to set up the SIM card virtually and not a physical transfer on your phone makes carrying over carriers from phone to phone much easier. battery lasts as long as the iPhone 13. As you may remember, it was much better than the iPhone 12. The iPhone 14 is a smooth, responsive phone and great for high-quality gaming or photo and video editing. Overall I think this is a great phone to purchase if you are looking for a durable and sustainable upgrade and I do think it is worth the extra hundred dollars from the 13.",5.0 out of 5 stars

My options were stock android without google (something like lineageOS) or iPhone. I tried lineageOS but there was always something breaking in my phone. It couldn't become my daily driver; I wish most of the things in android were open source like maps and some other proprietary google apps. In the current state, I was left with choosing iPhone. For long, I had debated with myself about buying iPhone or not, I was using OnePlus 7T for last 3.5 years. The phone stopped getting updates and had many bugs. The software changed a lot, I hated it. All these OEM betraying consumers made me switch to iPhone in the end. I can't trust any other brand to have the consistency like apple has. That's my take in the phone market.

While it has its strengths, it also falls short in some key areas.Pros:1. **Affordable Price**: The Realme Narzo 50i Prime is a budget-friendly phone, making it accessible for those looking for an affordable smartphone.2. **Decent Battery Life**: The 5000 mAh battery is one of the phone's standout features. It provides a good amount of juice to last through a day of moderate use.3. **Smooth Performance**: The octa-core processor handles everyday tasks and apps reasonably well, ensuring smooth operation for the most part.Cons:1. **Display Quality**: The display leaves much to be desired. Colors appear washed out, and the resolution is not sharp. It's a significant drawback, especially for media consumption.2. **Camera Performance**: The camera setup on this phone is rather basic. While it can capture decent photos in well-lit conditions, low-light photography is disappointing, and there's a noticeable lack of detail in images.3. **Limited RAM**: With only 4GB of RAM, the phone struggles with multitasking, and apps tend to reload frequently. This can be frustrating for users who like to switch between apps quickly.4. **Bloatware**: The Realme Narzo 50i Prime comes with a fair amount of pre-installed bloatware, which can be annoying. You'll need to spend some time uninstalling or disabling unnecessary apps.5. **Build Quality**: The phone feels a bit plasticky and not as sturdy as some of its competitors in the same price range.Overall, the Realme Narzo 50i Prime is an okay budget phone. If you're on a tight budget and prioritize battery life and basic functionality over display quality and camera performance, it might be worth considering. However, if you can stretch your budget a bit, there are better options available in the market that offer a more well-rounded smartphone experience.",3.0 out of 5 stars

1492,"Yesterday ordered this phone due to some urgency. Delivery received yesterday also. Configured the phone. It's a phone under 8k. Not good, but so so It is handy phone with 4+64 as well as there is Memory Card Tray also. Some of pre-installed games as well as snapchat, mojo, etc. were there, which needs time to uninstall. No Screen Guard / Tampered Glass on the phone screen. No Plascic Back Cover is there also, which really needed. The company can add hardware also for 'Fingerprint Sensor', this is the disadvantage of the phone, as the fingerpriint sensor is much more secured than the pass lock or face lock. Another thing you can't change the icon shaping, By default it is round, which I hate round shape icons on phone. I'm using Oneplus Nord 2T also, which has the features in software. Not comparing this Narzo with One plus, but they could provide this. Camera quality is so so. Now-a-days normal phone dialer is getting replaced by Google dialer, which has the call recording option, but in this case both of the parties can hear that their calls are getting recorded. They could bypass like Samsung, as Samsung has their own dialer with call recording facility.After one day of using it returned it to Amazon. Charging speed is very slow and incoming calls from any person is not clear. When I call back then it's ok. Not happy",4.0 out of 5 stars

1560,"I have purchased this phone for my mother, this is her first smart phone so i thought i should go for a simple smartphone with clean ui with a large battery. So bought this. Now let's talk about the pros and consPros:1. Large screen: the screen is really big and colours are bright.2. Large battery: 5000 mah battery is really useful, my mother doesn't use the phone too much so it's last for 2 to 3 days with minimal usage.3. Android go : it has the Android 13 go edition so it's light version that's why it's working smooth.4. Dual rear camera does it's job but the front camera is really impressive.5.Dialer: It has Xiaomi dialer so you can record call without announcement.Cons :1. No type C port so we have to carry an extra cable as all of our phone has type C port.2. Long Charging time: no fast charging provided so it's taking longer time to charge the battery.3. No widget options ( till now August 2023) so you can't add weather or clock or contact widget on the home screen.4. No double tap to screen on/off feature ( till now Aug 2023).5. It's taking time to load videos or the settings options on 2gb variant, i mean if i open YouTube it's taking 4 to 5 second to load the videos on YouTube ( I'm using the device on WiFi so no network issue, it's happening for the weak processor). I have installed WhatsApp from play store, nothing else installed on the phone but still it's taking some times for some app loading. But it's okay it's not a issue for someone who just started using smartphone.Also you can uninstall or disable maximum of preloaded apps. I have uninstalled maximum of those apps. Also I have disabled the Chrome browser, as my mother didn't search any thing on internet. I have disabled the browser so even if my mother clicked on any link on YouTube or on another apps it doesn't work so kind of safe for my mother also.So i just want to say this phone is just for calling, WhatsApp, for normal YouTube videos & music. Also i think if you are getting the 2GB variant under 6k then it's a good deal. Don't pay more for this even if you are buying 4gb 64gb it will not change much on the performance.Thank you.Edit 1 : Even after getting 3 software updates they didn't include the widgets option as well as the double tap function. So i think this option will not available in future also, may be this features are not for Android go editions. So keep that in mind, although my mother never complaint about the clok as she check the time from the notification bar or from the lock screen.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1562,"After using it for a month, I can state , the Redmi A2 (Classic Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) is an excellent budget smartphone that delivers impressive features and performance. From its vibrant display to its capable cameras and long-lasting battery, it offers a well-rounded experience for the price. If you are looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone, I highly recommend considering the Redmi A2.Pros:1. Great value for money: The Redmi A2 offers an impressive range of features and performance at an affordable price point.2. Vibrant display: The 6.52-inch IPS LCD screen delivers sharp and clear visuals, making it enjoyable for multimedia consumption.3. Smooth performance: The Mediatek Helio G36 chipset, coupled with the octa-core processor and 4GB RAM, ensures smooth multitasking and lag-free performance.4. Expandable storage: The device comes with 64GB of internal storage, which can be further expanded using the dedicated microSDXC card slot, providing ample space for your files and apps.5. Decent camera performance: The dual rear cameras capture satisfactory photos with good detail and color accuracy, and the addition of features like dual-LED flash and HDR enhances the camera's capabilities.6. Long-lasting battery: The 5000mAh non-removable battery offers excellent battery life, allowing for a full day of usage without worrying about running out of power.7. User-friendly interface: The Redmi A2 runs on Android 13 (Go edition) with MIUI, providing a user-friendly interface and a range of customization options.8. Sleek design: The device boasts a sleek and slim design, with the Classic Black color variant adding an elegant touch.9. Added benefit is warranty - 2 years [1 year + extra 1 year (special introductory offer)]Cons:1. Moderate display resolution: While the display is vibrant, the 720 x 1600 pixel resolution may not offer the highest level of sharpness compared to higher-end devices.2. Modest camera setup: The camera setup on the Redmi A2 is modest, which may not satisfy users who require advanced camera capabilities.3. Limited charging speed: The device supports 10W wired charging, which is not as fast as some other smartphones in the market.Please be aware that these benefits and drawbacks are based on individual usage and may change based on preferences and usage patterns.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1564,"Before saying anything about A2, I would like to mention properly that is a below ‚Çπ7,000 smartphone. In this slab of pricing, Xiaomi has packed a USB charger, decent battery which goes on from 13-15 hours in good use (non gaming, movie etc) in single charge.Camera is good, not exceptional.The OS feels like Stock Android. As Classic MIUI Apps seemed missing by me like notes, compass, IR Remote.Does not support 5GHz Wifi. Works smooth on 2.4Ghz Wifi.The built qualify is simply AWESOME. Feel in hand is Awesome.Brithness is pretty good, touch and response time is very smooth and fast. Bootup time is pretty fast too.Comes with a dedicated SD Card slot along with dual sim slots (total 3 slots in tray).In box they have packed the phone, charger, USB type A-B cable. (No tempered glass or back cover), No fingerprint or face unlock - REMEMBER THE PRICE.Final conclusion: the phone is good in this price range specially the smoothness, built quality, screen size, clean Android OS with majority Google's Apps like Google One, Google Gallery etc. Yes some small small things are missing but that is fine because the price is also kept pretty low. The Phone is good for those who have average use of smartphones or if you want to make this as a secondary business need smartphone. Or simply a phone for a school student.I recommend this product untill and unless Redmi asks you to pay more than ‚Çπ7500.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1640,"3 day battery is not a reality unless you don't use the phone at all.Screen quality looks good as drop down notch is not an intrusion. refresh of 90Htz will drain battery Faster.Camera looks good and I am not expecting it to work like an SLR or an apple for which you pay 5 times more.fact - 5g drains battery.This phone has two 5g bands only. 5g speeds on network is good but you cannot choose a 5g only option. Nokia 's global model has multiple 5g bands and they made this information hard to find for the device sold in India. They seem to have reduced the hardware to support multiple 5g bands which probably accounts for the drop in price of G42 over the model sold in EU. BTW, My previous Nokia 5.3 phone had all the Network listed on the box. this phone has listed 5g band info in the small booklet in very small prints. 5g seekers. Please validate your requirements before you choose.battery -2.5 hours of screen time used about 10% of battery which was mix of 1 hour youtube + 40 mins of call + other installations.Choice over other phones for reasons belowGorilla glass 3 ( old but at least some protection)software Update cycle which allows it be used as BYOD device for office emails due to regular security patches.Clean Android to avoid unwanted ads and ensure better control over device.Delivery was a in fragile package which had crushed the phone box, lucky that there was no damages to phone inside.I wonder how Reviewers could post a review after 1 day of launch and sing praises without even touching the phone.Dear Amazon , my previous review disappeared from Amazon which was to highlight the missing aspects of the phone and I wish it could be attributed to technical glitch..A sturdy handset with promised update for 3 years and a clean Android. 5g speed is good but phone will latch to only 2 bands of which n78 is a common 5g band. A let down by Nokia on the 5g front because if India has only 2 bands, all other mobile companies are lying to us or reverse is true.Nokia has not come out clean on this front.",3.0 out of 5 stars
1641,"After using for a day...!!Build quality: A typical Nokia product. In hand feel is good. The back panel looks so much good. Looks awesome.Display: It's doesn't look like a 720p display at all. The overall experience with a 90hz refresh rate is smooth and punchy. But content watching like videos on YouTube may feel little dull.Camera: The 50mp back camera is like 50/50. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's average. I haven't tested the 2mp cameras. 8mp front camera is below average. Camera app has some cool features. Use GCam for a good result. Picture quality will be improved drastically especially the front camera.Speaker: The single bottom firing speaker is loud and has good level of vocal details. But misses the bass. Overall average. It has a feature call boost volume which will increase the volume upto 10%. The earpiece is top quality.Software: Clean Android 13 with some pre installed app which is uninstallable.Overall a good phone in this price range. 5G bands only n28 and n78 available. Airtel 5G is working fine, don't know about Jio. Compass sensor is missing. I've also attached some shots taken with Nokia G42 5G.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1642,"The Nokia G42 5G is a standout product. It comes with a robust build, which is very Nokia-like. You feel it when you hold it - a premium-looking device with a premium in-the-hand feel for a not-so-premium price.Box Contents: Nokia G42 phone, a TPU case, a 20-watt charger, USB A to USB C cable. Earphones are neither advertised nor included. I use Bluetooth earphones anyway. The only main accessory you will need is a screen protector, as sand particles can scratch Gorilla glass too.The phone has a good weight, which gives the feel of a solid product. So, it is not the lightest phone out there, but it will feel significant to people like me, to whom a balanced weight gives the feeling of robustness.We got the Nokia G42 in the unique-looking Purple colorway, which looks more beautiful IRL than the digital renders. The phone performs very well for the price point, and I do not have a reason to complain. Nokia used a similar CPU in some high-priced phones (like the Nokia XR20). The CPU sustains well under the load, does not heat up, and delivers consistent results without throttling.The phone is smooth to the touch and fast & snappy to use. Almost all apps load quickly and run fine. The phone has 6GB of physical memory (RAM) and 128GB of UFS storage (some call it ROM). Nokia also offers virtual RAM up to 5GB on the Nokia G42 to keep up with the marketing trends started by the competition offering 12-16 GB RAM by using storage as RAM. However, the phone's 6GB onboard RAM is adequate enough that you will never need to use the much slower virtual RAM. If you still need it, virtual RAM can be enabled in 2 options - 2GB or 5GB from the phone's settings. It comes disabled OOB.The 50MP camera on the G42 takes good photos, and I cannot complain at this price point. The camera software in this phone is significantly improved from what is seen on old Nokia phones. It comes with a lot of camera modes and even a dedicated Pro mode for people who want to control the exposure, ISO, etc. The night mode takes good photos as well, and you may not need to look for a gcam port for this device.The phone supports dual 5G standby, i.e., both SIM cards will connect to the 5G network at the same time for calls as well as data. While 5G works fine on the device, and I can make 5G calls (Vo5G/VoNR), the Nokia website mentions that the phone only supports 2 5G bands. The limited band support might not provide the best possible 5G experience. I have contacted Nokia, and they said, ""It supports all the deployed 5G network bands in India"". So, I am not entirely sure which bands are supported; 5G on Airtel and Jio works fine. Jio can make VoNR calls, and Airtel cannot, but that's also the case for my Samsung S23 Ultra. Airtel does not have VoNR enabled yet.The software is clean; there are mostly Google apps pre-installed, along with 6-7 bloatware apps (like Netflix, Spotify, and Booking.com) that can be removed in 10 seconds if needed. So, there are no unwanted apps sending notifications or pre-installed to steal data. The phone is supposed to get 2 OS updates, which will eventually bring it to Android 15 over the years. The phone is also supposed to be supported with security patches every month until 08/2026. The phone sold in India is made in India.Overall, I am very happy with the phone. 4.5 stars (half deducted for missing 5G bands) from my side for a good attempt by HMD Global after a long time. I will update the review if I find something more worth mentioning. You can buy it if you're on the lookout for a good-performing and affordable 5G phone from a trusted brand.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1643,"The Nokia G42 5G is a great device. I have received it today and I noticed some post machining marks near the charging port, mic, speaker grills and near the headphone jack. The earpiece also has some worn out colour marks. There is no physical damage as such. The packaging I received was a joke. Apparently, the box in which the smartphone box was packed was not packed very well. The outermost package was completely sealed so it was okay.The display is the downside.

1724,"So Earlier I posted my 2 weeks review about this phone,now it has been one month since i bought it and this is what I found great and not so great about this phoneI'll write about my experience now1.One plus UI obviously is really good with almost zero bloatwares in it, The UI is really good and does not hang2.For charging- Yes this phone comes with a 80 Watt charger but supports upto 67W charging still making it go from 0-100 percent in less than an hour3.Battery lasts really good for a normal user, I have tested myself by going outside around 9 am at 100 percent battery and returning home late at night with still about 35% charge4.The phone has a plastic back and my variant i.e pastel lime is really good, the look is really premium5.Great sounding stereo speakers probably the loudest and clearest in this price segment,6. Display is IPS LCD not AMOLED which can be kind of a con for this phone but still being an IPS LCD it does not disappoints the standard is there.7. IPS LCD is 120hz which is very smooth but on some applications it automatically locks on 60hz like netflix youtube and many more apps.8. One plus has promised to give this phone 2 major android updates and 3 years of security updates you can find more about on their websiteA. Performance and camera1. It comes in with a snapdragon 695 5g processor in it which is pretty common in this budget2. Gaming is good as per the price segment, You can play Call of duty mobile(Smooth),apex legends and genshin impact smoothly on low settings obviously update-BGMI works on HD settings and MAX frame rate3. It has 8 gb ram in it and 8 gb is more than sufficient for normal use and more over it has expandable ram as well upto 8 gb, so what you can do is make your phone into8+8 ram4. Camera quality was really bad at first but an update which came around 2nd week of may fixed the camera by a lot. Daylight photos have gotten good HDR and colors are greatAlthough it does not provide Punchy colors in photos , its not a flaw for me because i dont like punchy color5. Night performance for camera can still be better.6.Video recording is available at only 1080p@30fps due to limitations of the processor, rest the video capture works great7.There is a slow mo feature as well also front+back camera recording simultaneouslyConclusionThere is a lot for improvement on this phone and the journey has just started , Lets hope that the updates can fix some of the issues and bring us new features as wellFor me I am a normal user with a little bit of gaming, I can rate this phone around 8/10 (top 5 in this range)Obviously there are better options but You can give this phone a chance as well :Düêêüêê",4.0 out of 5 stars
1725,"I have been using this phone for a week now and I am very impressed with its performance and features. The phone is sleek and lightweight, with a beautiful chromatic gray color that changes hue depending on the light. The display is bright and crisp, with a smooth 90Hz refresh rate that makes scrolling and gaming a pleasure. The camera is also amazing, with a 64MP main sensor that captures stunning details and colors. The night mode is especially impressive, as it can take clear and bright photos even in low-light conditions. The battery life is also great, as it can last for a full day of moderate to heavy use. The phone supports fast charging with the included 30W charger, which can charge the phone from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. The phone also has 5G connectivity, which makes browsing and streaming faster and smoother. The phone runs on OxygenOS 12, which is based on Android 12. The software is clean and user-friendly, with no bloatware or ads. It also has some useful features like dark mode, always-on display, Zen mode, and more. The phone also has a headphone jack, which is rare these days. The sound quality is decent, both from the speakers and the earphones. The phone also has a fingerprint scanner on the power button, which is fast and reliable. The phone also has face unlock, which works well in most situations.Overall, I am very happy with this phone and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a budget-friendly 5G smartphone with great performance and features. It is definitely worth the price and it offers a lot of value for money. It is one of the best phones I have ever used and I don't regret buying it at all.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1726,"Pros and Cons as per one month of usage: -Pro's1. Packed with completed assessories including 80W charger, Transparent back Case and pre-applied screen protector. Won't cost extra on pocket.2. Smooth software experience with 120 Hz high refresh rate.3. 8 GB & above RAM and has excellent ram management.4. True 5G with 10-11 5G bands, as minimum 8 5G bands are necessary for better and stable 5G network coverage.5. As expected, disappointment on camera has been fixed with 2nd software updates in the 1st week of May 2023.Cons1. Slightly less bright display may irritate in sunlight.2. The worst Google dailer that won't allow silent call recording, to directly place a videos call without sharing personal data on Google meet app i.e. without signing in to another Google spyware especially when two SIMs are installed.3.

1728,"I recently upgraded to the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G in Pastel Lime, and I've been thoroughly impressed with its performance and features. Here's what I love about it:**Pros:**1. **Affordable 5G:** The inclusion of 5G capabilities in a phone at this price point is a huge plus. Streaming and downloading content is lightning-fast, and I'm future-proofed for upcoming advancements in connectivity.2. **Sleek Design:** The Pastel Lime color is unique and adds a refreshing touch to the device. The slim profile and lightweight build make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.3. **Smooth Performance:** With 8GB of RAM, multitasking is a breeze. The phone handles various apps and tasks simultaneously without any lag or slowdowns.4. **Ample Storage:** The 128GB storage provides enough room for all my apps, photos, and videos. Plus, the option to expand storage via microSD card is a thoughtful addition.5. **Impressive Display:** The AMOLED display offers vibrant colors and deep blacks, enhancing my media consumption experience. The Full HD+ resolution ensures crisp visuals, whether I'm watching videos or browsing the web.**Cons:**1. **Average Camera Performance:** While the camera setup is decent, it doesn't quite match the quality of flagship devices. Photos in well-lit conditions turn out great, but low-light performance could be improved.2. **Plastic Back:** While the plastic back keeps the device lightweight, it may not feel as premium as glass-backed phones. A good quality case helps mitigate this, though.3. **Battery Life:** The battery life is good, but not exceptional. It easily lasts me through a day of moderate use, but I'd appreciate a bit more juice for heavy usage days.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G offers a compelling package of features at an affordable price. It's a great option for users who want to experience 5G connectivity without breaking the bank. The design, performance, and display quality are its standout features, making it an excellent value for money. While there are a few areas for improvement, the overall experience this phone provides is truly remarkable.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1764,"I recently purchased the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G and wanted to share my experience with this smartphone.In terms of specifications and features, this phone offers a lot for its price. The 5G capability is a great addition, providing faster data speeds and a smoother browsing experience. The overall performance is commendable, and it handles most applications and tasks with ease.However, I did encounter a camera issue after some usage. The camera app would show an error and close abruptly, which was frustrating. Initially, the customer service was not as helpful as I expected. They directed me to visit a service center, but unfortunately, these centers are not easily accessible in smaller towns. Fortunately, after a software update, the issue resolved itself, and the camera started functioning normally.Considering the price range, this smartphone competes well in the market. For users who primarily need a phone for calls and using light applications, this brand is worth considering. However, potential buyers should be aware of the possibility of encountering minor software glitches and limited accessibility to service centers in certain areas.In summary, the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G is a feature-rich smartphone with competitive specifications for its price. If you're a moderate user looking for a budget-friendly 5G-enabled phone, this is worth considering.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1765,"The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G has captured my attention with its blend of features, promising a solid performance in the 5G smartphone arena.

However, it's not without its shortcomings. The absence of a charger and the software experience's minor lags might be areas of concern for some users. Additionally, the lack of a night mode in the 4GB RAM variant and the limited 5G band support could impact certain user preferences and usage scenarios.In essence, the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G offers a commendable performance package, but its drawbacks should be considered in the context of your specific needs and priorities.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The phone came with a travel adapter included in the box, which is a nice bonus. Let me share my experience with this device.Performance:The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G boasts the world's first Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 chipset, and it truly lives up to the hype. The 6GB RAM paired with the powerful processor ensures smooth multitasking and lag-free performance even with heavy applications and games. I haven't faced any stuttering or slowdowns, and the 5G capability provides super-fast internet connectivity.Display:The 120Hz refresh rate on this phone is a game-changer. Scrolling through apps and websites is incredibly smooth and fluid. The colors are vibrant, and the display quality is top-notch. Whether you're watching videos or playing games, the visual experience is simply outstanding.Storage:With 128GB of internal storage, there's plenty of space for all my apps, photos, and videos. Plus, if you need more storage, you can always expand it using a microSD card, which is a convenient feature.Battery Life:The battery life is impressive as well. Even with heavy usage, the phone manages to last through the day comfortably. The inclusion of a charger in the box is a thoughtful touch, and it supports fast charging, which ensures you can quickly top up your battery when needed.Camera:The camera performance is good for the price range. The 48MP main sensor captures detailed and sharp images, especially in well-lit conditions. The 5MP macro and 2MP depth sensors are decent additions, but they don't deliver exceptional results in challenging lighting situations.Build Quality:The phone feels sturdy and well-built in hand. The Stellar Green color variant looks stunning with its unique gradient design. The device is also relatively lightweight, making it comfortable to carry around.Value for Money:Considering the features and performance, I believe the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G offers incredible value for money. It competes with devices that are priced higher but delivers a comparable experience at a more affordable price point.Overall, I highly recommend the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G to anyone in the market for a powerful and feature-packed smartphone without breaking the bank.

1864,"Here is my review of the iPhone 14 Pro Max after using it for a couple of weeks:The iPhone 14 Pro Max is the most advanced and powerful smartphone that Apple has made. It offers a stunning design, a superb display, a pro-level camera system, and a blazing-fast performance. It is not a cheap device, but it is worth every penny if you are looking for the best of the best.Design: The iPhone 14 Pro Max has a sleek and elegant design that feels premium in the hand. It has a flat 6.7-inch OLED display that covers almost the entire front of the device, with a pill-shaped notch at the top that houses the Face ID sensors and the selfie camera. The back of the device is made of textured matt glass that resists fingerprints and scratches, and the frame is made of stainless steel that adds durability and shine. The device comes in four beautiful colors: Space Black, Silver, Gold, and Deep Purple. The iPhone 14 Pro Max also has an IP68 rating, which means it can withstand water up to 6 meters deep for up to 30 minutes.Display: The display of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is one of its main highlights. It features a Super Retina XDR OLED display with a resolution of 2796x1290 pixels and a pixel density of 460 ppi. The display supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision, which means it can deliver stunning colors and contrast for watching videos and playing games. The display also has a refresh rate of 120Hz, which makes everything look smoother and more responsive. The display uses ProMotion technology, which adapts the refresh rate to the content on the screen, saving battery life and improving performance. The display also has an Always-On feature, which shows your personalized lock screen with your favorite widgets without having to tap the screen.Camera: The camera system of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is another major selling point. It features a quad-camera setup on the rear, consisting of a 48MP main camera, a 12MP ultra-wide camera, a 12MP 2x telephoto camera, and a 12MP 3x telephoto camera. The main camera has a quad-pixel sensor that can capture more detail and light in every shot. It also has a second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization, which reduces blur and shake in low-light conditions. The ultra-wide camera has a 120-degree field of view, which lets you capture more scenery and perspective in your photos. The telephoto cameras have optical-quality zoom, which lets you get closer to your subject without losing quality. The camera system also supports Night mode, Portrait mode, Panorama mode, Macro mode, Photographic Styles, and Smart HDR 4, which enhance your photos with advanced algorithms and effects. The camera system also supports Cinematic mode, which lets you shoot professional-looking videos in 4K HDR at 24 fps with depth-of-field control. You can also edit your videos in ProRes or Dolby Vision HDR formats on your device or on your Mac.Performance: The iPhone 14 Pro Max is powered by the A16 Bionic chip, which is the most powerful processor that Apple has ever created. It has a 6-core CPU, a 5-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine, which work together to deliver fast and smooth performance for any task. The A16 Bionic chip can handle demanding workloads such as gaming, video editing, augmented reality, machine learning, and more with ease. It also has a power-efficient design, which allows it to run at high speeds for longer without draining the battery.Battery: The battery life of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is impressive as well. It has a large 4,400 mAh battery that can last up to 29 hours of video playback or up to 23 hours of video streaming on a single charge. It also supports fast charging with a USB-C to Lightning cable or a MagSafe charger, which can charge up to 50% in just 30 minutes. It also supports wireless charging with any Qi-compatible charger or accessory.Overall experience: The iPhone 14 Pro Max is an amazing device that offers everything you could ask for in a smartphone. It has a gorgeous design, a brilliant display, a fantastic camera system, and an incredible performance. It is easy to use and secure with iOS 16, which offers many new features and improvements such as Dynamic Island, Action mode, FaceTime SharePlay, Live Text, Focus, Safari redesign, and more. It also works seamlessly with other Apple devices and services such as AirPods, Apple Watch, iCloud, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and more.The iPhone 14 Pro Max is not for everyone though. It is a very large and heavy device, which may not be comfortable for some people to hold or carry. It is also very expensive, starting at ‚Çπ1,29,900 for the 128GB model and going up to ‚Çπ1,69,900 for the 1TB model. It also does not have a headphone jack, a microSD card slot, or a fingerprint scanner, which may be deal-breakers for some users.However, if you are looking for the ultimate smartphone experience and you don't mind the size, the price, or the lack of some features, then the iPhone 14 Pro Max is the perfect choice for you. It is a device that will impress you with its design, display, camera, and performance. It is a device that will make you feel like a pro.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1865,"Apple hasn‚Äôt made any bones about the fact that there are certain products it has that aren‚Äôt meant for everyone. Some of these ‚Äî like the Mac Studio or even the Mac mini ‚Äî are way too niche and will be sought by those who really need them. And then there are those that bring the best of Apple at an expensive ‚Äî very expensive ‚Äî price point but are desired by many. The iPhone‚Äôs Pro models have always been in the category ‚Äî the coveted one, the desirable one, the one that makes you want to junk that financial prudence that has been drilled in you. The iPhone 14 Pro Max is very much that phone ‚Äî the best of Apple and by now you know that it is an expensive phone. Rs 1,39,900 is the starting price and there‚Äôs little point in debating on why it‚Äôs so expensive and whether it‚Äôs value for money or not. It‚Äôs an Apple product, it is an iPhone, and it is the Pro Max variant ‚Äî of course it will be expensive. Apple wants your money and the iPhone 14 Pro Max is that dangling proposition that may just want you to break the bank and get one.DESIGN AND DISPLAYSeen one? Seen all. If you have seen the iPhone 12 Pro Max or the iPhone 13 Pro Max then the iPhone 14 Pro Max has very little different to offer in terms of design. It‚Äôs a popular design with a stainless frame that looks elegant and the frosted glass back is still gorgeous to look at. Apple knows that this design is a hit and there‚Äôs no point in expecting it to change anytime soon. Generally, an Apple design lasts for years before a new one comes. Don‚Äôt believe us? Look at the MacBook Air, which followed a similar design philosophy for years till the M2 model arrived this year. So don‚Äôt expect Apple to make wholesale changes to the design every year, you will only get disappointed.The one remarkable thing about the design of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is that yes, you have seen it before and yes, it hasn‚Äôt changed but it still looks great. But do keep in mind that this is a really big phone. If you aren‚Äôt used to a big phone then perhaps think twice before getting this or look at the iPhone 14 Pro instead. I wouldn‚Äôt call it unwieldy but yes, it is certainly not a one-handed phone. The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra felt really big but this one feels rather bigger in the hand. And yes, it is heavy as well at 240 grams.The big size is preferred by many as it brings in a big display and it‚Äôs a compromise many would settle for on the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The 6.7-inch OLED display offers a resolution of 2796 x 1290 pixel and 460ppi pixel density. What‚Äôs that in common parlance? An excellent display that is great to look at, colour reproduction is accurate and the brightness levels are optimum. Apple claims that the iPhone 14 Pro Max offers the maximum brightness in a smartphone ‚Äî 2000 nits of brightness in direct sunlight. We had zero problems reading on the iPhone 14 Pro Max even when it was really sunny outside.The 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate works as smoothly as it did on the iPhone 13 Pro Max ‚Äî no complaints or no changes here to see. The display is extremely snappy and a lot of it is down to iOS 16 as well as Apple does handle animations much better than most of its competition does.If the refresh rate and other specs remain the same, then there‚Äôs something new in the form of the Always-on display. Better late than never, some may say. Apple is fashionably late but has arrived in some style. Now I am sure you must have read that some Android phone brought Always-on display first. Heck, even Google couldn‚Äôt resist the temptation to take a dig at Apple during its biggest hardware event of 2022. But Apple has created a perception that it isn‚Äôt in the rat race and that some features might not come first but they do come with a difference. Like the Always-on display.Apple‚Äôs implementation of Always-on display is unlike any other smartphone. What happens on the iPhone 14 Pro Max when Always-on display is turned on is that the lock screen is dimmed. ‚ÄúDisplay, display on the phone, who‚Äôs the prettiest of ‚Äòem all?‚Äù It‚Äôs the iPhone 14 Pro Max with the Always-on display. You can see notifications, lock screen widgets and everything else but it is subtly dimmed. If you have an iPhone and you use it for the first time, you might feel that was there a need for this? Not really but once you‚Äôve used it, I bet you will not be able to use the iPhone 14 Pro Max without toggling on the Always-on display.DYNAMIC ISLANDNow generally we tend to keep all display features in one sub-head but we are making an exception for the Dynamic Island. After all it is the belle of the ball, the headline act of the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Or at least it‚Äôs the most-talked about feature on this year‚Äôs iPhones. And it does deserve a separate section as it is delightfully done. The notch was Apple‚Äôs gift to the smartphone industry. The first year after the launch of iPhone X ‚Äî the first one with the notch ‚Äî Android brands made a beeline to adopt the notch as if Santa Claus handed it out on Christmas. But then Android phone makers came up with their really good iterations of it and Apple stuck with the notch until the Dynamic Island arrived with the iPhone 14 Pro models. And man, it is so well done that you just keep fiddling with it only for the first few days ‚Äî at least that‚Äôs what I found myself doing. The Dynamic Island is a different take on the notch and makes the use of that space which no one else ever thought of doing it before Apple. Not a fan of the name but this is a really cool feature to use and is not gimmicky at all.For someone who uses Apple Music a lot more than one should, the Dynamic Island is a treat. It will show the album artwork along the playback controls, and the waveform, AirPlay ‚Äî all in that tiny little space. If you are using any app and get an incoming call, then the Dynamic Island will show the alert and all the call controls. AirPods Pro‚Äôs battery life also appears in the Dynamic Island. Apple Maps directions also come on the Dynamic Island and so much so that at times I did ditch Google Maps for it because it looks really good.Apple has always had a way of showing all these notifications but never had a ‚Äòhome‚Äô ‚Äî which is now the Dynamic Island. In a few months, here‚Äôs hoping that other developers take advantage of the Dynamic Island as it is a really fun and useful feature. Apple is expected to launch Live Activities API soon and that‚Äôs when we will really see the Dynamic Island thrive and it is something that should get a lot of people excited. Is the feature good enough to pay the difference between the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro price? It certainly is if you want the complete iPhone experience.CAMERAIt has been well established that the iPhone cameras are one of the most consistent and versatile ones around. Apple seemed mightily reluctant to get in the megapixel race and remained steady with 12MP cameras. A case of better late than never yet again and once more Apple has done it differently. The primary camera now has a 48MP sensor, which produces some excellent images. All the images clicked from the 48MP camera have rich colours and look exceptionally vibrant and true to life. There are a lot of details captured especially in the images which were clicked using ProRAW. Like every other 48MP camera, Apple too uses pixel binning to give you 12MP images only but the ProRAW mode actually gives you 48MP images. And the difference is quite stark as more details are captured. But the trade-off is that images clicked with the 48MP camera consume a lot of space, like a lot. The photos we clicked ranged anywhere between 12MB to 42MB ‚Äî so use it rather judiciously. Of course, ProRAW is meant not just for utilising the 48MP camera.What works in the favour of the primary 48MP camera ‚Äî with and without pixel binning ‚Äî is the consistency it offers. You can be clicking in good lighting condition or not-so-good conditions, the iPhone 14 Pro Max delivers images that make you sit up and take note. Apple has certainly improved low-light photography as the iPhone 14 Pro Max does a wonderful job when the lights are dimmed. What the 48MP primary camera also gives is the option of 2x optical zoom lens ‚Äî a nice addition to the iPhone 14 Pro Max‚Äôs camera‚Äôs arsenal.The other 12MP cameras ‚Äî telephoto and ultra-wide ‚Äî also do a fine job of clicking images. Portraits clicked on the iPhone 14 Pro Max look great and bokeh effect is spot on. Apple‚Äôs computational photography has been a step ahead of others and on the iPhone 14 Pro Max you get the Photonic Engine. As per Apple, this is meant to improve colour reproduction and click better images in less light.The lack of zoom on the telephoto camera now does rankle a bit. The iPhone 14 Pro Max offers 3x zoom at a time when the likes of Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra can go up to 100x. I do wish Apple brings more zoom capabilities on the next iPhone as it is perhaps the only feature that is missing on these cameras.The Macro mode ‚Äî enabled automatically ‚Äî is a true delight on the iPhone 14 Pro Max. No one has done a better job with the macro mode than Apple as the results are truly excellent. Try capturing fabrics with the iPhone 14 Pro Max and the level of details is fascinating to see. You will find macro modes in so many smartphones‚Äô cameras but the iPhone 14 Pro Max is a cut above the rest.For the selfie/usfie/groupfie/whateverfie brigade, Apple has added a brand new camera. The 12MP camera now gets autofocus and it is really impressive. And it really shows in FaceTime calls or other video calls as well. There‚Äôs more clarity than there ever was on any iPhone. The front camera is a significant improvement on the iPhone 14 Pro Max.Where the iPhone 14 Pro Max‚Äôs camera really shines is videos. Apple brought Cinematic Mode last year with the iPhone 13 Pros and with the iPhone 14 Pros, you get the all-new Action Mode. No, it‚Äôs not a gimbal or anything like that. What it does is it really it offers really good stabilisation and that‚Äôs because Apple has improved EIS (electronic image stabilisation). You don‚Äôt get 4K recording with this mode as maximum resolution offered is 2.8K but it is still very good. The footage almost always remained really stable. The Cinematic Mode still remains great fun to use.Is this the best camera setup in any smartphone? Not exactly but it is certainly most versatile and consistent cameras in any smartphone. Almost every image is pleasing to look at and more than anything, the iPhone 14 Pro Max makes you want to click more images ‚Äî something that I can‚Äôt say about any other smartphone, except the Pixel phones.PERFORMANCE, BATTERY LIFEThis will be rather short and concise: the A-series Bionic processors on the iPhones have always been blazing fast and the iPhone 14 Pro Max with A16 is no different. The phone is a total powerhouse in every sense and handles all sorts of tasks comically well. You really can‚Äôt find any fault in the performance of the iPhone 14 Pro Max as it really is flawless. The iOS 16 experience is still getting refined so you might see a bug here and there but I expect Apple to sort that out soon.The iPhone 13 Pro Max by far had the best battery performance I have seen in all the phones reviewed in the last 12 months. Expectations were lofty from the iPhone 14 Pro Max and it was a rather bumpy start. In the first few days, with just under 5 hours of screen time, the phone had consumed close to 84% battery ‚Äî alarm bells did ring as Apple did tout the battery life of the iPhone 14 Pro Max. However after a few days normalcy was resumed as with six hours of screen time ‚Äî with Always-on enabled ‚Äî the iPhone 14 Pro Max still had 40% battery left. Does the Always-on display consume a lot of battery?Slightly but it‚Äôs not a battery guzzling feature. Overall, with a lot of streaming on Apple Music, Safari, WhatsApp, social media activities on a daily basis, the iPhone 14 Pro Max can really go on for a day ‚Äî and then some ‚Äî on a single charge.VERDICTApple has made a habit of making excellent smartphones and the iPhone 14 Pro Max is no different. There‚Äôs no escaping the fact that the iPhone 14 Pro Max is one of the most expensive smartphones you can buy ‚Äî starting at Rs 1,39,900 and goes up to Rs 1,89,900 (1TB storage variant). You might think that it will be a hard sell especially in a country like India. India still remains a vanilla iPhone island but the aspiration to go Pro is strong as ever.This year Apple has really separated the Pro models from the vanilla ones with the iPhone 14 series. And there is still an audience that salivates at the thought of getting an iPhone Pro ‚Äî perhaps they have used the vanilla and want an upgrade or they are the ones that just want the best of Apple. The iPhone 14 Pro Max gets the best of Apple in every sense. The display is a delight ‚Äî Dynamic Island is great fun ‚Äî and the cameras have been upgraded as well. Should you go for it? Without battling an eyelid as long as you can splash the cash The iPhone 14 Pro Max is one of the best smartphones money can buy.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1914,"I have purchased this phone for my mother, this is her first smart phone so i thought i should go for a simple smartphone with clean ui with a large battery. So bought this. Now let's talk about the pros and consPros:1. Large screen: the screen is really big and colours are bright.2. Large battery: 5000 mah battery is really useful, my mother doesn't use the phone too much so it's last for 2 to 3 days with minimal usage.3. Android go : it has the Android 13 go edition so it's light version that's why it's working smooth.4. Dual rear camera does it's job but the front camera is really impressive.5.Dialer: It has Xiaomi dialer so you can record call without announcement.Cons :1. No type C port so we have to carry an extra cable as all of our phone has type C port.2. Long Charging time: no fast charging provided so it's taking longer time to charge the battery.3. No widget options ( till now August 2023) so you can't add weather or clock or contact widget on the home screen.4. No double tap to screen on/off feature ( till now Aug 2023).5. It's taking time to load videos or the settings options on 2gb variant, i mean if i open YouTube it's taking 4 to 5 second to load the videos on YouTube ( I'm using the device on WiFi so no network issue, it's happening for the weak processor). I have installed WhatsApp from play store, nothing else installed on the phone but still it's taking some times for some app loading. But it's okay it's not a issue for someone who just started using smartphone.Also you can uninstall or disable maximum of preloaded apps. I have uninstalled maximum of those apps. Also I have disabled the Chrome browser, as my mother didn't search any thing on internet. I have disabled the browser so even if my mother clicked on any link on YouTube or on another apps it doesn't work so kind of safe for my mother also.So i just want to say this phone is just for calling, WhatsApp, for normal YouTube videos & music. Also i think if you are getting the 2GB variant under 6k then it's a good deal. Don't pay more for this even if you are buying 4gb 64gb it will not change much on the performance.Thank you.Edit 1 : Even after getting 3 software updates they didn't include the widgets option as well as the double tap function. So i think this option will not available in future also, may be this features are not for Android go editions. So keep that in mind, although my mother never complaint about the clok as she check the time from the notification bar or from the lock screen.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1916,"After using it for a month, I can state , the Redmi A2 (Classic Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) is an excellent budget smartphone that delivers impressive features and performance. From its vibrant display to its capable cameras and long-lasting battery, it offers a well-rounded experience for the price. If you are looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone, I highly recommend considering the Redmi A2.Pros:1. Great value for money: The Redmi A2 offers an impressive range of features and performance at an affordable price point.2. Vibrant display: The 6.52-inch IPS LCD screen delivers sharp and clear visuals, making it enjoyable for multimedia consumption.3. Smooth performance: The Mediatek Helio G36 chipset, coupled with the octa-core processor and 4GB RAM, ensures smooth multitasking and lag-free performance.4. Expandable storage: The device comes with 64GB of internal storage, which can be further expanded using the dedicated microSDXC card slot, providing ample space for your files and apps.5. Decent camera performance: The dual rear cameras capture satisfactory photos with good detail and color accuracy, and the addition of features like dual-LED flash and HDR enhances the camera's capabilities.6. Long-lasting battery: The 5000mAh non-removable battery offers excellent battery life, allowing for a full day of usage without worrying about running out of power.7. User-friendly interface: The Redmi A2 runs on Android 13 (Go edition) with MIUI, providing a user-friendly interface and a range of customization options.8. Sleek design: The device boasts a sleek and slim design, with the Classic Black color variant adding an elegant touch.9. Added benefit is warranty - 2 years [1 year + extra 1 year (special introductory offer)]Cons:1. Moderate display resolution: While the display is vibrant, the 720 x 1600 pixel resolution may not offer the highest level of sharpness compared to higher-end devices.2. Modest camera setup: The camera setup on the Redmi A2 is modest, which may not satisfy users who require advanced camera capabilities.3. Limited charging speed: The device supports 10W wired charging, which is not as fast as some other smartphones in the market.Please be aware that these benefits and drawbacks are based on individual usage and may change based on preferences and usage patterns.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1917,"Nice mobile in this price range I get it for only 5.4k it's an good price1 camera: camera üì∏ quality is very nice for camera 5/52 gaming : in this price range it comes with an good processor no lag on small games like temple run , Subway surfers ect 4/53 display: the display quality is also good at this price range 4/54 battery: battery will last upto more than 8 hrs on simple use like browsing , YouTube,calls ,camera 4/55 charging time: it comes with 10w changer it takes more than 4 hrs to Full change 4/5Overall score is 4/5",4.0 out of 5 stars
1918,"Before saying anything about A2, I would like to mention properly that is a below ‚Çπ7,000 smartphone. In this slab of pricing, Xiaomi has packed a USB charger, decent battery which goes on from 13-15 hours in good use (non gaming, movie etc) in single charge.Camera is good, not exceptional.The OS feels like Stock Android. As Classic MIUI Apps seemed missing by me like notes, compass, IR Remote.Does not support 5GHz Wifi. Works smooth on 2.4Ghz Wifi.The built qualify is simply AWESOME. Feel in hand is Awesome.Brithness is pretty good, touch and response time is very smooth and fast. Bootup time is pretty fast too.Comes with a dedicated SD Card slot along with dual sim slots (total 3 slots in tray).In box they have packed the phone, charger, USB type A-B cable. (No tempered glass or back cover), No fingerprint or face unlock - REMEMBER THE PRICE.Final conclusion: the phone is good in this price range specially the smoothness, built quality, screen size, clean Android OS with majority Google's Apps like Google One, Google Gallery etc. Yes some small small things are missing but that is fine because the price is also kept pretty low. The Phone is good for those who have average use of smartphones or if you want to make this as a secondary business need smartphone. Or simply a phone for a school student.I recommend this product untill and unless Redmi asks you to pay more than ‚Çπ7500.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Nokia 's global model has multiple 5g bands and they made this information hard to find for the device sold in India. They seem to have reduced the hardware to support multiple 5g bands which probably accounts for the drop in price of G42 over the model sold in EU. BTW, My previous Nokia 5.3 phone had all the Network listed on the box. this phone has listed 5g band info in the small booklet in very small prints. 5g seekers. Please validate your requirements before you choose.battery -2.5 hours of screen time used about 10% of battery which was mix of 1 hour youtube + 40 mins of call + other installations.Choice over other phones for reasons belowGorilla glass 3 ( old but at least some protection)software Update cycle which allows it be used as BYOD device for office emails due to regular security patches.Clean Android to avoid unwanted ads and ensure better control over device.Delivery was a in fragile package which had crushed the phone box, lucky that there was no damages to phone inside.I wonder how Reviewers could post a review after 1 day of launch and sing praises without even touching the phone.Dear Amazon , my previous review disappeared from Amazon which was to highlight the missing aspects of the phone and I wish it could be attributed to technical glitch..A sturdy handset with promised update for 3 years and a clean Android. 5g speed is good but phone will latch to only 2 bands of which n78 is a common 5g band. A let down by Nokia on the 5g front because if India has only 2 bands, all other mobile companies are lying to us or reverse is true.Nokia has not come out clean on this front.",3.0 out of 5 stars
2077,"After using for a day...!!Build quality: A typical Nokia product. In hand feel is good. The back panel looks so much good. Looks awesome.Display: It's doesn't look like a 720p display at all. The overall experience with a 90hz refresh rate is smooth and punchy. But content watching like videos on YouTube may feel little dull.Camera: The 50mp back camera is like 50/50. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's average. I haven't tested the 2mp cameras. 8mp front camera is below average. Camera app has some cool features. Use GCam for a good result. Picture quality will be improved drastically especially the front camera.Speaker: The single bottom firing speaker is loud and has good level of vocal details. But misses the bass. Overall average. It has a feature call boost volume which will increase the volume upto 10%. The earpiece is top quality.Software: Clean Android 13 with some pre installed app which is uninstallable.Overall a good phone in this price range. 5G bands only n28 and n78 available. Airtel 5G is working fine, don't know about Jio. Compass sensor is missing. I've also attached some shots taken with Nokia G42 5G.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2078,"The Nokia G42 5G is a standout product. It comes with a robust build, which is very Nokia-like. You feel it when you hold it - a premium-looking device with a premium in-the-hand feel for a not-so-premium price.Box Contents: Nokia G42 phone, a TPU case, a 20-watt charger, USB A to USB C cable. Earphones are neither advertised nor included. I use Bluetooth earphones anyway. The only main accessory you will need is a screen protector, as sand particles can scratch Gorilla glass too.The phone has a good weight, which gives the feel of a solid product. So, it is not the lightest phone out there, but it will feel significant to people like me, to whom a balanced weight gives the feeling of robustness.We got the Nokia G42 in the unique-looking Purple colorway, which looks more beautiful IRL than the digital renders. The phone performs very well for the price point, and I do not have a reason to complain. Nokia used a similar CPU in some high-priced phones (like the Nokia XR20). The CPU sustains well under the load, does not heat up, and delivers consistent results without throttling.The phone is smooth to the touch and fast & snappy to use. Almost all apps load quickly and run fine. The phone has 6GB of physical memory (RAM) and 128GB of UFS storage (some call it ROM). Nokia also offers virtual RAM up to 5GB on the Nokia G42 to keep up with the marketing trends started by the competition offering 12-16 GB RAM by using storage as RAM. However, the phone's 6GB onboard RAM is adequate enough that you will never need to use the much slower virtual RAM. If you still need it, virtual RAM can be enabled in 2 options - 2GB or 5GB from the phone's settings. It comes disabled OOB.The 50MP camera on the G42 takes good photos, and I cannot complain at this price point. The camera software in this phone is significantly improved from what is seen on old Nokia phones. It comes with a lot of camera modes and even a dedicated Pro mode for people who want to control the exposure, ISO, etc. The night mode takes good photos as well, and you may not need to look for a gcam port for this device.The phone supports dual 5G standby, i.e., both SIM cards will connect to the 5G network at the same time for calls as well as data. While 5G works fine on the device, and I can make 5G calls (Vo5G/VoNR), the Nokia website mentions that the phone only supports 2 5G bands. The limited band support might not provide the best possible 5G experience. I have contacted Nokia, and they said, ""It supports all the deployed 5G network bands in India"". So, I am not entirely sure which bands are supported; 5G on Airtel and Jio works fine. Jio can make VoNR calls, and Airtel cannot, but that's also the case for my Samsung S23 Ultra. Airtel does not have VoNR enabled yet.The software is clean; there are mostly Google apps pre-installed, along with 6-7 bloatware apps (like Netflix, Spotify, and Booking.com) that can be removed in 10 seconds if needed. So, there are no unwanted apps sending notifications or pre-installed to steal data. The phone is supposed to get 2 OS updates, which will eventually bring it to Android 15 over the years. The phone is also supposed to be supported with security patches every month until 08/2026. The phone sold in India is made in India.Overall, I am very happy with the phone. 4.5 stars (half deducted for missing 5G bands) from my side for a good attempt by HMD Global after a long time. I will update the review if I find something more worth mentioning. You can buy it if you're on the lookout for a good-performing and affordable 5G phone from a trusted brand.",5.0 out of 5 stars
2079,"The Nokia G42 5G is a great device. I have received it today and I noticed some post machining marks near the charging port, mic, speaker grills and near the headphone jack. The earpiece also has some worn out colour marks. There is no physical damage as such. The packaging I received was a joke. Apparently, the box in which the smartphone box was packed was not packed very well. The outermost package was completely sealed so it was okay.The display is the downside.

Sound loudness is moderate, neither too low nor too high.It's a good option for u to go with. Not recommended for gaming purpose.",4.0 out of 5 stars

2221,"I found scratches and paint removal at multiple places on the phone. Tried returning on amazon, buy only options were damaged screen and faulty device. Does it mean if there are scratches and usage marks at other places you are not responsible?Then shared this with lava on social media asking why kind of quality check do they have? They promised to send technician to home and replace the phone. But technician called and started saying since its bought on amazon I should contact amazon. Does it mean if we buy online, Lava doesn't have any accountability? What kind of system is this?Also, the phone heats up too much while charging. My 3 year old Samsung phone doesn't heat so much even now.UPDATE: Lava social media team reached out, connected with local service team, and arranged for replacement of device. However, they give only white devices under replacement. And that also had a small scratch. Their finishing and quality check need to improve a lot. They also sent a technician to check heating issue, but by then the ambient temperature had decreased by 8¬∞C, so heating issue was not there. I guess when ambient temperature is high, the device gets heated up abnormally. But otherwise, the device is good. And happy with onsite service response, and proactive approach of social media team.

2246,"So Earlier I posted my 2 weeks review about this phone,now it has been one month since i bought it and this is what I found great and not so great about this phoneI'll write about my experience now1.One plus UI obviously is really good with almost zero bloatwares in it, The UI is really good and does not hang2.For charging- Yes this phone comes with a 80 Watt charger but supports upto 67W charging still making it go from 0-100 percent in less than an hour3.Battery lasts really good for a normal user, I have tested myself by going outside around 9 am at 100 percent battery and returning home late at night with still about 35% charge4.The phone has a plastic back and my variant i.e pastel lime is really good, the look is really premium5.Great sounding stereo speakers probably the loudest and clearest in this price segment,6. Display is IPS LCD not AMOLED which can be kind of a con for this phone but still being an IPS LCD it does not disappoints the standard is there.7. IPS LCD is 120hz which is very smooth but on some applications it automatically locks on 60hz like netflix youtube and many more apps.8. One plus has promised to give this phone 2 major android updates and 3 years of security updates you can find more about on their websiteA. Performance and camera1. It comes in with a snapdragon 695 5g processor in it which is pretty common in this budget2. Gaming is good as per the price segment, You can play Call of duty mobile(Smooth),apex legends and genshin impact smoothly on low settings obviously update-BGMI works on HD settings and MAX frame rate3. It has 8 gb ram in it and 8 gb is more than sufficient for normal use and more over it has expandable ram as well upto 8 gb, so what you can do is make your phone into8+8 ram4. Camera quality was really bad at first but an update which came around 2nd week of may fixed the camera by a lot. Daylight photos have gotten good HDR and colors are greatAlthough it does not provide Punchy colors in photos , its not a flaw for me because i dont like punchy color5. Night performance for camera can still be better.6.Video recording is available at only 1080p@30fps due to limitations of the processor, rest the video capture works great7.There is a slow mo feature as well also front+back camera recording simultaneouslyConclusionThere is a lot for improvement on this phone and the journey has just started , Lets hope that the updates can fix some of the issues and bring us new features as wellFor me I am a normal user with a little bit of gaming, I can rate this phone around 8/10 (top 5 in this range)Obviously there are better options but You can give this phone a chance as well :Düêêüêê",4.0 out of 5 stars
2247,"I have been using this phone for a week now and I am very impressed with its performance and features. The phone is sleek and lightweight, with a beautiful chromatic gray color that changes hue depending on the light. The display is bright and crisp, with a smooth 90Hz refresh rate that makes scrolling and gaming a pleasure. The camera is also amazing, with a 64MP main sensor that captures stunning details and colors. The night mode is especially impressive, as it can take clear and bright photos even in low-light conditions. The battery life is also great, as it can last for a full day of moderate to heavy use. The phone supports fast charging with the included 30W charger, which can charge the phone from 0 to 70% in just 30 minutes. The phone also has 5G connectivity, which makes browsing and streaming faster and smoother. The phone runs on OxygenOS 12, which is based on Android 12. The software is clean and user-friendly, with no bloatware or ads. It also has some useful features like dark mode, always-on display, Zen mode, and more. The phone also has a headphone jack, which is rare these days. The sound quality is decent, both from the speakers and the earphones. The phone also has a fingerprint scanner on the power button, which is fast and reliable. The phone also has face unlock, which works well in most situations.Overall, I am very happy with this phone and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a budget-friendly 5G smartphone with great performance and features. It is definitely worth the price and it offers a lot of value for money. It is one of the best phones I have ever used and I don't regret buying it at all.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2248,"Pros and Cons as per one month of usage: -Pro's1. Packed with completed assessories including 80W charger, Transparent back Case and pre-applied screen protector. Won't cost extra on pocket.2. Smooth software experience with 120 Hz high refresh rate.3. 8 GB & above RAM and has excellent ram management.4. True 5G with 10-11 5G bands, as minimum 8 5G bands are necessary for better and stable 5G network coverage.5. As expected, disappointment on camera has been fixed with 2nd software updates in the 1st week of May 2023.Cons1. Slightly less bright display may irritate in sunlight.2. The worst Google dailer that won't allow silent call recording, to directly place a videos call without sharing personal data on Google meet app i.e. without signing in to another Google spyware especially when two SIMs are installed.3. The tall & 200 gms, a bulky smartphone would require both the hand for operation for most of the people.4. One plus has not clarified anything about future updates. But users can expect 2 Android updates and 3 years of security update.5. Existing 2-3 uninstallable bloatwares could have been avoided to make the Oxygen OS = (Colour OS - bloatwares).6. Some youtubers may say it doesn't support 4K videos. It is upto you, how many times you watch 4K videos online that requires 5-7 times of data? If you are comfortable with 5-7 times extra data recharge, definitely you should look at 4K supporting devices.7. Does not justify it's ‚Çπ 20k price.

2250,"I recently upgraded to the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G in Pastel Lime, and I've been thoroughly impressed with its performance and features. Here's what I love about it:**Pros:**1. **Affordable 5G:** The inclusion of 5G capabilities in a phone at this price point is a huge plus. Streaming and downloading content is lightning-fast, and I'm future-proofed for upcoming advancements in connectivity.2. **Sleek Design:** The Pastel Lime color is unique and adds a refreshing touch to the device. The slim profile and lightweight build make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.3. **Smooth Performance:** With 8GB of RAM, multitasking is a breeze. The phone handles various apps and tasks simultaneously without any lag or slowdowns.4. **Ample Storage:** The 128GB storage provides enough room for all my apps, photos, and videos. Plus, the option to expand storage via microSD card is a thoughtful addition.5. **Impressive Display:** The AMOLED display offers vibrant colors and deep blacks, enhancing my media consumption experience. The Full HD+ resolution ensures crisp visuals, whether I'm watching videos or browsing the web.**Cons:**1. **Average Camera Performance:** While the camera setup is decent, it doesn't quite match the quality of flagship devices. Photos in well-lit conditions turn out great, but low-light performance could be improved.2. **Plastic Back:** While the plastic back keeps the device lightweight, it may not feel as premium as glass-backed phones. A good quality case helps mitigate this, though.3. **Battery Life:** The battery life is good, but not exceptional. It easily lasts me through a day of moderate use, but I'd appreciate a bit more juice for heavy usage days.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G offers a compelling package of features at an affordable price. It's a great option for users who want to experience 5G connectivity without breaking the bank. The design, performance, and display quality are its standout features, making it an excellent value for money. While there are a few areas for improvement, the overall experience this phone provides is truly remarkable.",4.0 out of 5 stars

2286,"I am writing this review after using it for1 month. This is my first apple device. I upgraded from OP7T to this device. My prime requirement was superior battery life and looking for an overall decent good phone. So I was initially inclined to buying OP 11 but ever since OP was acquired by VIVO, I felt that OP has lost its originality and as a result my interest for OP11 was somehow withdrawn. After one month of usage of IP14+, I find that in some aspect IOS is superior to android and in some other aspects android is superior to IOS. As a very normal mobile phone user, I‚Äôll try to highlight the difficulties and good aspects of the device I noticed while using it for the last one month:Pros:1. Battery life is outstanding. When I was using single sim, I was having 40-42 hrs. of battery backup with moderate usage ( I don‚Äôt play games, moderate usage includes streaming content in Netflix, Hotstar etc. for 2-3 hrs.). When I started using duel sim also, the battery life is easily lasting for more than 36 hrs.2. I absolutely liked the Face ID feature and I really appreciate the security features offered by IOS. Be it for banking app or for any other apps, no unnecessary third party apps are required for protection & privacy of apps. My child can‚Äôt install any gaming app without my Faceid and it is such a relief.3. Astounding sound quality. This phone bar delivers amazing sound output. You‚Äôll experience absolute satisfaction while watching content in this phone with such high quality sound output. My wife is using Galaxy S22 Ultra and I find that the sound output of IP14+ is superior to this.4. I read that screen refresh rate is 60Hz, but it hardly mattered to me. I could not notice any distraction due to this in my day to day activities. But I must say that watching content in S22 Ultra is more eye-pleasing but this does not mean that screen quality of IP14+ is any less than the S22 series.5. Duel 12 megapixel camera offers you such incredible picture quality that many flagship android phones with triple/ quadruple camera having fancy megapixels should feel ashamed of. Day or night , you get awesome photos. No unnecessary beautifying of photos , you simply see what you click. If I look bad, the camera will show me just like that. Video quality is also great specially in cinematic mode.6. Lesser battery & lesser ram than most of the android phones out there but performs like a beast non-stop.Cons:1. Android is so easy to use. It gives you the liberty to do as per your own terms. As a very normal user of mobile , simple activities like toggling with SIM data, choosing the sim to call, auto connection of Bluetooth with car (once it is paired), browsing the file manager, copying & pasting any files to & from the mobile device, connecting a SSD / pen drive etc. is such a piece of cake in android phones. In IOS, calls will only go from the primary sim. You do not get the choice of selecting the sim to call your contacts. You can call a contact from your secondary sim only if you received a call from the caller in the secondary sim. I normally toggle between Jio & Airtel for mobile data. Toggling the mobile data is so damn easy in android phones through drop down menu but in IOS I have to go to settings everytime to select the primary / secondary sim for default data.2. File browsing in IOS is another nightmare for me. In 1 month I started missing the android file browsing utility. I can not copy a file from external source (pendrive / ssd) to iphone. When connected to PC, I am only allowed to copy camera photos and videos to PC. May be IOS is restricting all these to enhance security of the device which I really appreciate but can‚Äôt help forgetting the swiftness of android handling all these shortcomings.3. Can you imagine, the calculator app can not handle any sum involving more than 9 digits.4. As I said camera in this phone is great. But I paid 90 thousand for the phone and for the price paid for I at least deserved a macro lens and 3x optical zoom lens in the camera system. Forget about macro photography & zooming if you are sticking with non-pro versions.Anyways, pro‚Äôs & con‚Äôs makes a product perfect. Despite all the shortfalls which are bothering me, I liked this device because in many other important aspects it outperformed other flagship android devices. In the end I must say, for battery, ram management and security IOS rocks and for ease of use android rocks.",5.0 out of 5 stars
2287,"The phone is a standard iPhone blown up to the pro max proportion. While tech reviewers might consider this phone a failure , for those who need a good battery and a large screen will love this.In the us as price difference between this and pro max is 200 , people will scale up and get that. However in India the price difference between this a pro max can get you an iPhone 12/13 itself. So it works best for the price.89999 is expensive but I picked it up in the sale for 71 with some more cash back thrown in. Now the value promise is damn enticing.As it uses the 13pro‚Äôs A15 processor and 2 back cameras from the 13pro , it‚Äôs no slouch. In the battery department as it‚Äôs a shameful 60hz display that it has to power , it lasts long. The lack of pro-motion display on a phone at this price point is a disgrace when even phones at half the price come with super amoled 120hz displaysThat aside , as I use it exclusively for work I am happy with it. I take all my WebEx meetings from here and slack and outlook at refreshed fanatically when I‚Äôm on the move. I can read all the documents and not worry about eye strain.I am not the best judge for camera as I use this only to capture moments rather than insta pics etc. but it takes decent photos. Post processing may not be for all.Summarizing , it‚Äôs a good phone for a slightly inflated price point. It does a damn good job in being a phone that lasts long.Update : after using it extensively for 2 weeks i charge it once in about 30-40 hours and this is not an exaggeration. I charge before i go to sleep and it lasts me the whole next day night + till the day after till noon or 2pm. This has been consistent behaviour with about 4-5 hours of screen on time.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2288," I am a Android user and just got my hands on iPhone just because of this Yellow dirty fellow color üíõI just loved the color and also wanted a light weight phone and as a fan of a big phones. This was perfect I guess. Because of that Apple hype and iPhone selfies you know. Also, its a different color which is unusual. I have not completely shifted to iPhone as I have kept my Android phone as well which is OnePlus 7T Pro, so, as its name, that phone is also a pro one only, using it from last 4 years and it still works like a beast, no performance issues.So, let me tell you what I found good in this phone and what isn't going well.Pros:‚Ä¢ Very smooth screen and no performance issues.‚Ä¢ Lightweight and attractive.‚Ä¢ Battery lasts almost a day and half if you don't play games and use it normally.Cons:‚Ä¢ It is very delicate, and I got a little scratch on the screen very first day, as it wasn't protected by a screen guard but I just sliped it in my pocked and it may got rubbed with jeans pocket button on anything but screen should not be this delicate, so always go for a screen protector as it isn't scratchless screen.‚Ä¢ Its a long long process to backup your iPhone if you have a windows PC. May be this is same with Mac, Idk but that's difficult.‚Ä¢ You can't use it without a case and sides are to be covered all the time as they attract scratchs and dents very easily.So, in built quality I must say, Apple should improve it.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2289,"It‚Äôs my first iphone and i see that it has a verygood battery life, as I‚Äôve used it for 15-16 days and one single charge upto 100% can easily hold till 2complete days, in one charge cycle I‚Äôve watched6eposids of 30mins each and a movie of 2hr25min.Overall batter is really osm, I didn‚Äôt expect this from iphone. I usually keep the power between 30% to 80% and this holds for 1 to 1(1/2) in a decent use of continuous screen time about 5 to 6hrs smoothly.Well battery is good..(single battery% stands for 9-10minutes on light usage if rough usage then 7-8min definitely)Now come to it‚Äôs performance,Obviously with appleA15 chipset it‚Äôs really soo smooth, overall having a 60hz display while all ther brand are running with 120hz display. But still i say it is smooth to a good decent level.If i come to gaming side, no doubt u can go for it, but as its display is 60hz it may get u some change if u are a heavy gamer(I‚Äôm don‚Äôt play much gamesüòÖ)Well come to the camera part,Obviously iPhones are verywell known for their camera quality, compared to pro series it has only 12+12 Mp camera setup it doesn‚Äôt have 48mp setup as pro. But still it best pics as good as pro.On screen brightness I not impressed with it, It‚Äôs not that bright to see under heavy sunlight quite difficult but can be seen but not clear.Well compared to pro, pro can be easily seen under heavy sun easily without any difficulties. Can be seen clearly.On waterproof, no doubt you can swim with it üòÖI‚Äôve done it twice and daily I carry it while I‚Äôm bathing.Definitely üëç good.On build quality, screen with ceramic display it‚Äôs really soo durable, I‚Äôve placed screen on heavy surfaces without tempered glass and i can‚Äôt see any scratches on the screen. But edges are quite disappointing with aluminium frame is quite delicate on third day after buying it slipped from my had on one side of edge and boom it shot with a slight dent on edge.If i talk about Speakers they are really good and easily audible at a heavy traffic noise too. Overall speakers are good üëçOverall i can say it‚Äôs worth to spend 80k on this mobile.So you can go for it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

2309,"iPhone is an apt case of marketting on hype when fools are full around. I shifted from Android to this phone and I am just regretting my choice of having an iPhone. I have data extensive job where I need to share data seamlessly from my phone and need to do back also.My Google One drive has stopped working on iPhone as from iPhone you can't use google drive backup to backup your phone data. So you need to buy iCloud. Ok I bought that too with Rs 200 PM for it, and yet I can't use it. Because with my email ID somewhere someone has mapped his phone number, and my email ID icloud does not take. Though all notifications of my iphone is coming on my same email ID which I access everyday!So next was to map my phone number as apple ID. That I did. But using my phone as apple ID I cant log to icloud from anywhere else except my phone! You can't transfer your files using bluetooth to you PC because MC BC iPhone does not allow Bluetooth file transfer but only fancy Air*FcUking*Drop which again works only on Apple devices only...so you buy your laptop pad etc Apply only!So you come to USB tethering to transfer the files...and here too, you feel suffocated as iPhone does not show your phone drive on any system except apple...so you can't transfer files even using USB tethering except useless photos and videos!I strictly suggest you all to avoid taking iPhone and better stick to Android. After using android, you feel suffocated using this useless garbage called iPhone. Its just hype. Even data security is hype and useless. No one is better than Google drive in having secure backup of your every file and accessible everywhere. And iPhone stands nowhere near it. It is just monopolizing garbage trap to which any sensible person would not fall into. My sense gad gone for toss.",2.0 out of 5 stars

2315,"Post 2 week review:I have just switched from android to iPhone. I didn‚Äôt before as I was used to large screen android phones and the normal iPhone was too small for me, also the Pro Max was too expensive and I really wasn‚Äôt interested in the camera too much. So when the iPhone plus came around I realised it was the perfect phone for me.Even though they keep saying it‚Äôs camera, chipset etc ..is not as good as the PRO models, so far I haven‚Äôt seen anywhere it‚Äôs lacking. But for someone who‚Äôs into photography maybe there‚Äôll be a difference, however for the average user this phone is more than adequate. For this price I think this is the best deal!It does take a while to get used to ios coming from android, but it‚Äôs nothing overwhelming, besides there are enough YouTube videos to guide you!All in all I highly recommend this phone for those looking for a premium experience without any high end insane specs. And buy atleast 256 gb.. trust me..!",5.0 out of 5 stars

2317,"I mainly starting looking for the phone with the best battery life. I‚Äôm getting over 2.5 days‚Ä¶yes DAYS..of usage. Dang! That‚Äôs the best battery life I‚Äôve seen in any phone I‚Äôve used so far.The 60hz display doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs ultra smooth anyway. Most iPhones are.The screen is great. Big, punchy. The software is stable. The Face ID is super helpful to not have to type in passwords systemwide.I have to get used to the added heft though. I come from a Pixel 4a, which was a petite 5.8incher in a plastic shell.The one downside to buying this phone is it‚Äôs lock-in with magsafe. Now I have to specifically purchase cases, car mounts, chargers etc that cater to it. None of my existing modes are compatible..including the cable. Lightning. Damn it, Apple!All of these extras are easily going to pinch your pocket.. deeply..on top of the premium paid in purchasing an iPhone in India in the first place.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I think nobody can beat Iphone camera pictures quality.3) Battery after heavy usage I got it for more than 24 hours (100% to 25%)4) For phone banking and money transaction, apple has highest security.5) Speed is goodCons:1) Apple should have incorporated 120 Hz flash rate instead they kept at 60Hz in this model.2) No call recording option.3) If you have used to Andriod, then it will take time to adjust to IOS OS.",5.0 out of 5 stars

A normal camera and an entry level processor. Not for gaming or exteme usage. OneUI core doesn't include many features in normal OneUI, but all the common features are present. Usually, a non enthusiast would never notice the eliminated features.Note: OneUI doesn't have internet speed meternon status bar, have to use 3rd party apps. Also blocking internet usage for specific apps is a little bit pain in the ass, if you have to do it. Except these, OneUI is the best smartphone UI, in my opinion.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The screen clarity was not good.. the images were appearing more reddish/yellowish.. even video clarity was very poor.. the videos in 720p seemed more clear in my earlier phone M30s rather than videos in 1080p in this phone.2. In the name security the phone was hiding all the data & shows white screen (snap attached) when you switch between applications. you can only see app icons which is very hectic thing when you have type anything from one to another specially like otp or numbers..3. And the worst part was screenshot... the phone was not allowing me to take screenshot in any app or any case due its security policy...I complained on Samsung members app also contacted online samsung customer care but didn't help..(online support is worst.. they treats you like a old school guy like you know nothing about smartphone)After visiting Samsung Customer Care in person, they reseted the software.

2366,"I recently had the opportunity to use the latest smartphone model, and I must say that my experience was a mixed bag. While it does have some noteworthy features, there are several areas where improvements are needed.Starting with the positives, the battery backup of this device is commendable. It offers an impressive lifespan, allowing me to use it throughout the day without constantly worrying about running out of power. This is definitely a strong advantage for users who heavily rely on their smartphones for various tasks.However, I encountered a few drawbacks that significantly impacted my overall satisfaction. Firstly, the back panels of the device produce an unpleasant noise when held, which can be quite irritating and diminishes the overall quality of the phone. Additionally, the display did not meet my expectations. The visual quality and clarity fell short, resulting in a subpar viewing experience. This is an important aspect of any smartphone, and I was disappointed by the underwhelming display performance.Furthermore, the camera capabilities of the device were average at best. While it managed to capture decent photos in well-lit environments, it struggled in low-light situations, resulting in grainy and lackluster images. Considering the significance of smartphone photography in today's world, this is an area that could definitely benefit from improvement.Another frustrating aspect was the network connectivity issues. There were instances where the phone failed to establish a stable internet connection, necessitating a restart. This inconvenience disrupted my workflow and hindered my ability to access online content seamlessly. Additionally, I found the GPS to be unreliable, with frequent calibration problems and poor detection accuracy. This was particularly frustrating when relying on navigation apps or location-based services.",3.0 out of 5 stars

But there still remain many samsung apps which I don't use and I cannot uninstall. Samsung pay cannot store your credit card information. Only UPI and your IDs etc can be kept there. If you want to use credit card in any online transaction, you will still have to take the plastic card out of your pocket to punch in the details if you do not memorize it.The more weight and thickness of this phone are the only cons for me.

2400,I didn't like the SIM tray setup. It's inconvenient to swap/change SIMs. Having a base to hold the SIMs in place would have been helpful.Biggest disappointment is on the exchange program. Amazon is relying on DA to assess the phone and they are always trying to reduce the value if they suspect a minor thing. I'm my case a discoloration corners was concluded as screen defect and was advised to pay the balance amount if wanted to go ahead with exchange.

2426,"About the phoneApple phone without a second delay, I would say it is better than all android phones I have used. The phone is like water, it flows in a way you want and shaping in your way. In a best way possible, the phone is designed to only show what the user wants and eliminating unnecessary ads, features that I have seen in android.Why it is better than Android?You pay too much money for Apple products, obviously you experience the features, physical components , camera lens etc. Apart from basic things, you can also enjoy the best applications available in app store. If you are a developer you might know the app store policy for application publish and their security posture towards handling payment apps etc. They publish best application and the way the apps, its modules switches is just flawless. Due to the so called strict policy of privacy program with Apple products, iPhone can pop up a box in your screen if any apps wants to track your activity with other applications. +1 respect for apple to show such concern with user.Apple phones are same ? like 13 vs 14The reason 14 is same as 13 may be business practice followed from 11th edition. But please note that iPhone making changes internally like physical components (small change in battery performance, lens in 14 edition), additional features but that may not satisfy you to buy 14 edition. If you do not find ""the very few changes"" interesting in 14, go for 13. Because physical and even cameras are not visually very much different in 13 vs 14 comparison. Also you get 13 for cheap :)14 is just added features but that is not for daily use, the features real time use is rare case. But the best part is there is no extra cost between 13 vs 14 prices (except extra 10k slash)Concern you must have.Apple is not giving chargers and their silicon cases are very expensive (but very good in touch and scratch friendly in back due to silk layer). This is an issue for sure. You have to buy charger not coming with USB C and claiming that you help carbon footprint, understandable but not customer friendly business model. Even after the purchase I had to spend at least 7k for charger and case.Apple care.I am not buying it, I pay for phone which is already expensive for this premium and apple care does have strict policy that if you understand that is waste. Instead I find a private insurance to make things better.",5.0 out of 5 stars

2429,"It is just a review from my side so that its good for you to know before buying rather than regretting later.Positives:* Showoff* Camera* Sound* Security (they say, bt that blocks so many accessibility options for me)* So many awesome features as all iphone users say (which probably I will use once in a lifetime)Negatives for me (You may like it):1. No shortcut to change between vibration and no vibration frequently.2. No end call button on the lock screen.3. Call list is nonsense. It shows phone, whatsap and all other calls in same list.4. Go to a specific contact in call history n you can see only history of one day. Total length of call history is 100. Most probably you will not be able to find call history of previous week for a specific contact.5. Need of Itunes to copy music from PC to phone.6. No file manager like android where we can see and access complete folder structure.7. No silent and vibrate mode notification on screen.8. Need to buy separate adapter n earphones after already spending double.9. Cannot remove torch icon in iphone14 from lock screen. You may end up switching it on unwillingly.10. BT and WiFi shortcuts will just disconnect them. To turn off you need to go to Settings screen and turn it off again.11. In so many places, either text or files, there is no Select All option. (I'm waiting for android users to get all pics received in whatsapp after a trip).12. Takes a lot of time to get detected by devices when hotspot is on.13. At some screen you get stuck and you will miss the back button.14. Copy some mp3 files to your iphone and you will never be able to find it with default music app.15. Every app will be either on lot of home screens or organised under some groups. You will never get a clean home screen with 2 or 3 most frequently used apps and all other apps in a swipe up menu like android.16. No fingerprint sensor.Adding to the list after using for 2 months:17. Cannot turn off camera shutter sound in general mode.18. No option to flag contact as spam/scam.19. If you connect wireless BT device, it won't show battery percentage of BT device.20. You get a notification while using phone and you miss to open it, then you will not see it until you remember yourself to open notification screen. Notification icons won't be pinned on top of the screen like Android.21. If you use 2 SIM and want to switch mobile data between SIMs, there is no shortcut than going to Settings screen. Also, cannot see current amount of data used or left.List goes on and on, try it yourself.. No iphone owner speaks about limitations. Some people like iphone for these and others hate it for these. If you can pay double and handle these adjustments with work arounds, go ahead. Once you unlock and give your phone to someone, or once you give access permissions to apps, even iphone is not most secure. Fr example, If you are driving and someone wants to use your phone for music/maps etc., then you have to give your password, because there is no fingerprint option and face recogniton feature will become dangerous option.",3.0 out of 5 stars

2448,"The Apple iPhone 14 is overall a great phone for anyone who is looking for high speed, excellent camera quality, and a day-long of battery life. The squared-off sides are more comfortable to hold in your hand in my opinion. I purchased this one and so far my experience has been wonderful. Something I like about this phone is its fast speed along with the different options the camera gives you. I wouldn't say the iPhone 14 has a better camera than the 13, rather I think they are more similar and there wasn't a dramatic improvement. The battery life is something that I wish was a little longer. It last about an hour or two more than the average iPhone 13, but does charge faster. I have been able to receive about a 50% charge in 30 minutes. Another great feature of this phone is the painless eSIM setup. Being able to set up the SIM card virtually and not a physical transfer on your phone makes carrying over carriers from phone to phone much easier. battery lasts as long as the iPhone 13. As you may remember, it was much better than the iPhone 12. The iPhone 14 is a smooth, responsive phone and great for high-quality gaming or photo and video editing. Overall I think this is a great phone to purchase if you are looking for a durable and sustainable upgrade and I do think it is worth the extra hundred dollars from the 13.",5.0 out of 5 stars

My options were stock android without google (something like lineageOS) or iPhone. I tried lineageOS but there was always something breaking in my phone. It couldn't become my daily driver; I wish most of the things in android were open source like maps and some other proprietary google apps. In the current state, I was left with choosing iPhone. For long, I had debated with myself about buying iPhone or not, I was using OnePlus 7T for last 3.5 years. The phone stopped getting updates and had many bugs. The software changed a lot, I hated it. All these OEM betraying consumers made me switch to iPhone in the end. I can't trust any other brand to have the consistency like apple has. That's my take in the phone market.

2546,"I have purchased this phone for my mother, this is her first smart phone so i thought i should go for a simple smartphone with clean ui with a large battery. So bought this. Now let's talk about the pros and consPros:1. Large screen: the screen is really big and colours are bright.2. Large battery: 5000 mah battery is really useful, my mother doesn't use the phone too much so it's last for 2 to 3 days with minimal usage.3. Android go : it has the Android 13 go edition so it's light version that's why it's working smooth.4. Dual rear camera does it's job but the front camera is really impressive.5.Dialer: It has Xiaomi dialer so you can record call without announcement.Cons :1. No type C port so we have to carry an extra cable as all of our phone has type C port.2. Long Charging time: no fast charging provided so it's taking longer time to charge the battery.3. No widget options ( till now August 2023) so you can't add weather or clock or contact widget on the home screen.4. No double tap to screen on/off feature ( till now Aug 2023).5. It's taking time to load videos or the settings options on 2gb variant, i mean if i open YouTube it's taking 4 to 5 second to load the videos on YouTube ( I'm using the device on WiFi so no network issue, it's happening for the weak processor). I have installed WhatsApp from play store, nothing else installed on the phone but still it's taking some times for some app loading. But it's okay it's not a issue for someone who just started using smartphone.Also you can uninstall or disable maximum of preloaded apps. I have uninstalled maximum of those apps. Also I have disabled the Chrome browser, as my mother didn't search any thing on internet. I have disabled the browser so even if my mother clicked on any link on YouTube or on another apps it doesn't work so kind of safe for my mother also.So i just want to say this phone is just for calling, WhatsApp, for normal YouTube videos & music. Also i think if you are getting the 2GB variant under 6k then it's a good deal. Don't pay more for this even if you are buying 4gb 64gb it will not change much on the performance.Thank you.Edit 1 : Even after getting 3 software updates they didn't include the widgets option as well as the double tap function. So i think this option will not available in future also, may be this features are not for Android go editions. So keep that in mind, although my mother never complaint about the clok as she check the time from the notification bar or from the lock screen.",4.0 out of 5 stars

2548,"After using it for a month, I can state , the Redmi A2 (Classic Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) is an excellent budget smartphone that delivers impressive features and performance. From its vibrant display to its capable cameras and long-lasting battery, it offers a well-rounded experience for the price. If you are looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone, I highly recommend considering the Redmi A2.Pros:1. Great value for money: The Redmi A2 offers an impressive range of features and performance at an affordable price point.2. Vibrant display: The 6.52-inch IPS LCD screen delivers sharp and clear visuals, making it enjoyable for multimedia consumption.3. Smooth performance: The Mediatek Helio G36 chipset, coupled with the octa-core processor and 4GB RAM, ensures smooth multitasking and lag-free performance.4. Expandable storage: The device comes with 64GB of internal storage, which can be further expanded using the dedicated microSDXC card slot, providing ample space for your files and apps.5. Decent camera performance: The dual rear cameras capture satisfactory photos with good detail and color accuracy, and the addition of features like dual-LED flash and HDR enhances the camera's capabilities.6. Long-lasting battery: The 5000mAh non-removable battery offers excellent battery life, allowing for a full day of usage without worrying about running out of power.7. User-friendly interface: The Redmi A2 runs on Android 13 (Go edition) with MIUI, providing a user-friendly interface and a range of customization options.8. Sleek design: The device boasts a sleek and slim design, with the Classic Black color variant adding an elegant touch.9. Added benefit is warranty - 2 years [1 year + extra 1 year (special introductory offer)]Cons:1. Moderate display resolution: While the display is vibrant, the 720 x 1600 pixel resolution may not offer the highest level of sharpness compared to higher-end devices.2. Modest camera setup: The camera setup on the Redmi A2 is modest, which may not satisfy users who require advanced camera capabilities.3. Limited charging speed: The device supports 10W wired charging, which is not as fast as some other smartphones in the market.Please be aware that these benefits and drawbacks are based on individual usage and may change based on preferences and usage patterns.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2549,"Nice mobile in this price range I get it for only 5.4k it's an good price1 camera: camera üì∏ quality is very nice for camera 5/52 gaming : in this price range it comes with an good processor no lag on small games like temple run , Subway surfers ect 4/53 display: the display quality is also good at this price range 4/54 battery: battery will last upto more than 8 hrs on simple use like browsing , YouTube,calls ,camera 4/55 charging time: it comes with 10w changer it takes more than 4 hrs to Full change 4/5Overall score is 4/5",4.0 out of 5 stars
2550,"Before saying anything about A2, I would like to mention properly that is a below ‚Çπ7,000 smartphone. In this slab of pricing, Xiaomi has packed a USB charger, decent battery which goes on from 13-15 hours in good use (non gaming, movie etc) in single charge.Camera is good, not exceptional.The OS feels like Stock Android. As Classic MIUI Apps seemed missing by me like notes, compass, IR Remote.Does not support 5GHz Wifi. Works smooth on 2.4Ghz Wifi.The built qualify is simply AWESOME. Feel in hand is Awesome.Brithness is pretty good, touch and response time is very smooth and fast. Bootup time is pretty fast too.Comes with a dedicated SD Card slot along with dual sim slots (total 3 slots in tray).In box they have packed the phone, charger, USB type A-B cable. (No tempered glass or back cover), No fingerprint or face unlock - REMEMBER THE PRICE.Final conclusion: the phone is good in this price range specially the smoothness, built quality, screen size, clean Android OS with majority Google's Apps like Google One, Google Gallery etc. Yes some small small things are missing but that is fine because the price is also kept pretty low. The Phone is good for those who have average use of smartphones or if you want to make this as a secondary business need smartphone. Or simply a phone for a school student.I recommend this product untill and unless Redmi asks you to pay more than ‚Çπ7500.",4.0 out of 5 stars

This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",4.0 out of 5 stars

2679,"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured. LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",4.0 out of 5 stars

2724,"I got this phone for a relative of mine who's a grandma.1. User-Friendly Interface: She appreciated the clean and straightforward interface of the Nord CE 2 Lite. Navigating through the menus was a breeze, and she quickly got the hang of it without needing any help.2. Comfortable Design: The phone is a bit on the bigger side but it's lightweight design was perfect for the grandma's hands. She found it easy to hold and operate, even during long conversations.3. Clear Display: The Nord CE 2 Lite's display impressed the grandma with its clarity and vibrant colors. Watching her favorite family videos and photos became a joy on this device.4. Decent Camera: While not a photography enthusiast, the grandma found the camera quality to be more than sufficient for capturing precious moments with her grandchildren.5. Reliable Performance: Nord CE 2 Lite handled everyday tasks smoothly, whether it was browsing the internet, sending messages, or making video calls. The grandma noticed minimal lag, which was a big plus.6. No-Nonsense Features: The phone's limited pre-installed apps and bloatware-free experience were appreciated by the grandma. It saved her from the confusion of unnecessary apps cluttering the screen.7. Affordable Price: It isn't a flag ship from One Plus but pretty close and it doesn't burn a hole in your pocket as well.8. Learning Curve: While the overall experience was positive, the grandma did find it slightly challenging to get accustomed to certain gestures and settings initially. However, after a few days, it became second nature.Overall, I'd say in current market, this is one of the phones you can go for without hesitation.",5.0 out of 5 stars

2726,"After using the phone for a day, I feel corners have been cut in various areas:JN1 sensor is not that great in low light. Color is typical samsung style with oversaturated greens. Interesting to note that JN1 is also being used in Samsung's new F23.Thermal management is very poor. Device heats up in normal usage within minutes if the screen brightness is high. Same is the case when camera app is opened/simple games on flipkart gamezone are played. There are reports on youtube of narzo50's camera shutting down on hot days.Above scenarios and 120Hz adaptive refresh rate also drain battery like crazy.Speaker and earpiece do not have crispiness (upper treble), instead sound like white noise. Earpiece volume is low. So is the speaker volume when on call. On the other hand, speaker volume is decent while playing back videos.Flashlight is half as bright as normal smartphones. I don't really know if company did cost cutting here, or its a software bug.No fm radio and secondary mic.Minor features I missed if shifting from miui to realmeui - e.g. the gallery app is not as good as miui one, requiring more taps for basic opeeations like viewing whatsapp images folder.Mediocre ram management with realmeui 2, android 11.To be fair, I could not find any major bug in realmeui 2.0 so far. The lcd display is fantastic, and very well calibrated with relatively cooler white point, as opposed to yellowish 5500-6500k super amoled. There was no green or purple tint. Touch response was excellent. Screen protector, case, fast charger, usb c cable were present. The phone feels much slimmer than my bulky F22 due to its thin body, 10gm less weight and sleek case. Camera app has full fledged manual mode, something absent from Samsung's F22.Disclaimer: Above impression has been made after using 4 smartphones over last 8 years: Asus Zenfone 5, Redmi 4, Redmi 7A, Samsung F22.Strongly consider other current alternatives too, like Redmi note 11, Poco m4 pro, Poco m4 pro 5g, Redmi note 10t 5g, Samsung F22, Samsung F23, Moto G42 before buying Narzo 50.More info: Do not fall for bloatwares like glance when setting up the phone. Check as few check boxes as possible before blindly clicking 'I agree'. Turn off content recommendation by going to the Settings -> Additional Settings -> Get Recommendations and switch the green toggle off. To remove bloatwares that cannot be uninstalled usual way, follow excellent guide by youtuber 'tech office' mentioning all realme app names required for adb commands. I was able to uninstall hot apps/games this way.UPDATE:Detailed camera comparison between Samsung F22 and Narzo 50:Samsung's HDR algo seems more sophisticated, narzo unnaturally brightens some shadows too much, there is also some oversharpening.Both cameras choose cool auto white balance, which results in bluer skies but lifeless greeneries even in 'golden hours'. However, narzos colors become more 'hue accurate' after choosing 6000-6500k white point in 'expert mode', whereas samsung still delivers bluish green foliage colors at cloudy white balance. Narzo strangely does some weak auto hdr even in 'expert mode', but samsung fully turns it off in 'pro mode', resulting unusable photos.However, when using night mode, narzo's photos appear more cleaner but less saturated at night. Gcam 8.5 for narzo is not optimized properly and gives noisy night photos with greenish cast and crushed shadows, much worse than realme's night mode. On the other hand, thereas no gcam and no camera2api support for F22. At night, you can take long exposure shots (upto 8/16/32secs) through 'expert mode' by manually choosing shutter speed in narzo, something you can't do in F22. This however requires tripod support and whenever done properly, the results are very good.You have manual 'film' mode in narzo, whereas you can't even manually set white balance in F22's video mode, as samsung's lower end galaxys don't have 'pro video' mode.",3.0 out of 5 stars

2776,"I recently purchased the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G and wanted to share my experience with this smartphone.In terms of specifications and features, this phone offers a lot for its price. The 5G capability is a great addition, providing faster data speeds and a smoother browsing experience. The overall performance is commendable, and it handles most applications and tasks with ease.However, I did encounter a camera issue after some usage. The camera app would show an error and close abruptly, which was frustrating. Initially, the customer service was not as helpful as I expected. They directed me to visit a service center, but unfortunately, these centers are not easily accessible in smaller towns. Fortunately, after a software update, the issue resolved itself, and the camera started functioning normally.Considering the price range, this smartphone competes well in the market. For users who primarily need a phone for calls and using light applications, this brand is worth considering. However, potential buyers should be aware of the possibility of encountering minor software glitches and limited accessibility to service centers in certain areas.In summary, the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G is a feature-rich smartphone with competitive specifications for its price. If you're a moderate user looking for a budget-friendly 5G-enabled phone, this is worth considering.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2777,"The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G has captured my attention with its blend of features, promising a solid performance in the 5G smartphone arena. Here's a comprehensive review of my experience with this device:Pros:Great Performance: The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G delivers on its promise of excellent performance, making multitasking, gaming, and app usage a smooth and seamless experience.Good Battery Life: With respectable battery endurance, the device keeps up with daily demands, ensuring you stay connected and entertained throughout the day.120Hz Display: The inclusion of a 120Hz display adds fluidity to interactions and enhances the visual experience, especially during gaming and scrolling.Reliable Camera Performance: The camera system of the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G proves dependable, capturing moments with clarity and accuracy.Premium Design: The device's design exudes a sense of premium craftsmanship, making it a stylish addition to your tech ensemble.Cons:Missing Charger in the Box: The absence of a charger in the package might be disappointing to users who expect a complete out-of-the-box experience.Minor Lag and Software Experience: While the device's performance is commendable, some users might notice minor lags across the UI, indicating room for software optimization to enhance the overall user experience.Lack of Night Mode in 4GB RAM Variant: Users of the 4GB RAM variant are left without the convenience of a night mode, potentially affecting low-light photography.Limited 5G Bands: The device supports only two 5G bands, which could limit its compatibility and usability in certain regions.Final Thoughts:The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G stands out for its notable strengths in performance, battery life, display quality, camera capabilities, and premium design. However, it's not without its shortcomings. The absence of a charger and the software experience's minor lags might be areas of concern for some users. Additionally, the lack of a night mode in the 4GB RAM variant and the limited 5G band support could impact certain user preferences and usage scenarios.In essence, the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G offers a commendable performance package, but its drawbacks should be considered in the context of your specific needs and priorities.",4.0 out of 5 stars

2801,"I recently purchased the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G in Stellar Green color, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every way. The phone came with a travel adapter included in the box, which is a nice bonus. Let me share my experience with this device.Performance:The iQOO Z6 Lite 5G boasts the world's first Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 chipset, and it truly lives up to the hype. The 6GB RAM paired with the powerful processor ensures smooth multitasking and lag-free performance even with heavy applications and games. I haven't faced any stuttering or slowdowns, and the 5G capability provides super-fast internet connectivity.Display:The 120Hz refresh rate on this phone is a game-changer. Scrolling through apps and websites is incredibly smooth and fluid. The colors are vibrant, and the display quality is top-notch. Whether you're watching videos or playing games, the visual experience is simply outstanding.Storage:With 128GB of internal storage, there's plenty of space for all my apps, photos, and videos. Plus, if you need more storage, you can always expand it using a microSD card, which is a convenient feature.Battery Life:The battery life is impressive as well. Even with heavy usage, the phone manages to last through the day comfortably. The inclusion of a charger in the box is a thoughtful touch, and it supports fast charging, which ensures you can quickly top up your battery when needed.Camera:The camera performance is good for the price range. The 48MP main sensor captures detailed and sharp images, especially in well-lit conditions. The 5MP macro and 2MP depth sensors are decent additions, but they don't deliver exceptional results in challenging lighting situations.Build Quality:The phone feels sturdy and well-built in hand. The Stellar Green color variant looks stunning with its unique gradient design. The device is also relatively lightweight, making it comfortable to carry around.Value for Money:Considering the features and performance, I believe the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G offers incredible value for money. It competes with devices that are priced higher but delivers a comparable experience at a more affordable price point.Overall, I highly recommend the iQOO Z6 Lite 5G to anyone in the market for a powerful and feature-packed smartphone without breaking the bank.

2880,"Here is my review of the iPhone 14 Pro Max after using it for a couple of weeks:The iPhone 14 Pro Max is the most advanced and powerful smartphone that Apple has made. It offers a stunning design, a superb display, a pro-level camera system, and a blazing-fast performance. It is not a cheap device, but it is worth every penny if you are looking for the best of the best.Design: The iPhone 14 Pro Max has a sleek and elegant design that feels premium in the hand. It has a flat 6.7-inch OLED display that covers almost the entire front of the device, with a pill-shaped notch at the top that houses the Face ID sensors and the selfie camera. The back of the device is made of textured matt glass that resists fingerprints and scratches, and the frame is made of stainless steel that adds durability and shine. The device comes in four beautiful colors: Space Black, Silver, Gold, and Deep Purple. The iPhone 14 Pro Max also has an IP68 rating, which means it can withstand water up to 6 meters deep for up to 30 minutes.Display: The display of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is one of its main highlights. It features a Super Retina XDR OLED display with a resolution of 2796x1290 pixels and a pixel density of 460 ppi. The display supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision, which means it can deliver stunning colors and contrast for watching videos and playing games. The display also has a refresh rate of 120Hz, which makes everything look smoother and more responsive. The display uses ProMotion technology, which adapts the refresh rate to the content on the screen, saving battery life and improving performance. The display also has an Always-On feature, which shows your personalized lock screen with your favorite widgets without having to tap the screen.Camera: The camera system of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is another major selling point. It features a quad-camera setup on the rear, consisting of a 48MP main camera, a 12MP ultra-wide camera, a 12MP 2x telephoto camera, and a 12MP 3x telephoto camera. The main camera has a quad-pixel sensor that can capture more detail and light in every shot. It also has a second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization, which reduces blur and shake in low-light conditions. The ultra-wide camera has a 120-degree field of view, which lets you capture more scenery and perspective in your photos. The telephoto cameras have optical-quality zoom, which lets you get closer to your subject without losing quality. The camera system also supports Night mode, Portrait mode, Panorama mode, Macro mode, Photographic Styles, and Smart HDR 4, which enhance your photos with advanced algorithms and effects. The camera system also supports Cinematic mode, which lets you shoot professional-looking videos in 4K HDR at 24 fps with depth-of-field control. You can also edit your videos in ProRes or Dolby Vision HDR formats on your device or on your Mac.Performance: The iPhone 14 Pro Max is powered by the A16 Bionic chip, which is the most powerful processor that Apple has ever created. It has a 6-core CPU, a 5-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine, which work together to deliver fast and smooth performance for any task. The A16 Bionic chip can handle demanding workloads such as gaming, video editing, augmented reality, machine learning, and more with ease. It also has a power-efficient design, which allows it to run at high speeds for longer without draining the battery.Battery: The battery life of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is impressive as well. It has a large 4,400 mAh battery that can last up to 29 hours of video playback or up to 23 hours of video streaming on a single charge. It also supports fast charging with a USB-C to Lightning cable or a MagSafe charger, which can charge up to 50% in just 30 minutes. It also supports wireless charging with any Qi-compatible charger or accessory.Overall experience: The iPhone 14 Pro Max is an amazing device that offers everything you could ask for in a smartphone. It has a gorgeous design, a brilliant display, a fantastic camera system, and an incredible performance. It is easy to use and secure with iOS 16, which offers many new features and improvements such as Dynamic Island, Action mode, FaceTime SharePlay, Live Text, Focus, Safari redesign, and more. It also works seamlessly with other Apple devices and services such as AirPods, Apple Watch, iCloud, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and more.The iPhone 14 Pro Max is not for everyone though. It is a very large and heavy device, which may not be comfortable for some people to hold or carry. It is also very expensive, starting at ‚Çπ1,29,900 for the 128GB model and going up to ‚Çπ1,69,900 for the 1TB model. It also does not have a headphone jack, a microSD card slot, or a fingerprint scanner, which may be deal-breakers for some users.However, if you are looking for the ultimate smartphone experience and you don't mind the size, the price, or the lack of some features, then the iPhone 14 Pro Max is the perfect choice for you. It is a device that will impress you with its design, display, camera, and performance. It is a device that will make you feel like a pro.",5.0 out of 5 stars
2881,"Apple hasn‚Äôt made any bones about the fact that there are certain products it has that aren‚Äôt meant for everyone. Some of these ‚Äî like the Mac Studio or even the Mac mini ‚Äî are way too niche and will be sought by those who really need them. And then there are those that bring the best of Apple at an expensive ‚Äî very expensive ‚Äî price point but are desired by many. The iPhone‚Äôs Pro models have always been in the category ‚Äî the coveted one, the desirable one, the one that makes you want to junk that financial prudence that has been drilled in you. The iPhone 14 Pro Max is very much that phone ‚Äî the best of Apple and by now you know that it is an expensive phone. Rs 1,39,900 is the starting price and there‚Äôs little point in debating on why it‚Äôs so expensive and whether it‚Äôs value for money or not. It‚Äôs an Apple product, it is an iPhone, and it is the Pro Max variant ‚Äî of course it will be expensive. Apple wants your money and the iPhone 14 Pro Max is that dangling proposition that may just want you to break the bank and get one.DESIGN AND DISPLAYSeen one? Seen all. If you have seen the iPhone 12 Pro Max or the iPhone 13 Pro Max then the iPhone 14 Pro Max has very little different to offer in terms of design. It‚Äôs a popular design with a stainless frame that looks elegant and the frosted glass back is still gorgeous to look at. Apple knows that this design is a hit and there‚Äôs no point in expecting it to change anytime soon. Generally, an Apple design lasts for years before a new one comes. Don‚Äôt believe us? Look at the MacBook Air, which followed a similar design philosophy for years till the M2 model arrived this year. So don‚Äôt expect Apple to make wholesale changes to the design every year, you will only get disappointed.The one remarkable thing about the design of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is that yes, you have seen it before and yes, it hasn‚Äôt changed but it still looks great. But do keep in mind that this is a really big phone. If you aren‚Äôt used to a big phone then perhaps think twice before getting this or look at the iPhone 14 Pro instead. I wouldn‚Äôt call it unwieldy but yes, it is certainly not a one-handed phone. The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra felt really big but this one feels rather bigger in the hand. And yes, it is heavy as well at 240 grams.The big size is preferred by many as it brings in a big display and it‚Äôs a compromise many would settle for on the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The 6.7-inch OLED display offers a resolution of 2796 x 1290 pixel and 460ppi pixel density. What‚Äôs that in common parlance? An excellent display that is great to look at, colour reproduction is accurate and the brightness levels are optimum. Apple claims that the iPhone 14 Pro Max offers the maximum brightness in a smartphone ‚Äî 2000 nits of brightness in direct sunlight. We had zero problems reading on the iPhone 14 Pro Max even when it was really sunny outside.The 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate works as smoothly as it did on the iPhone 13 Pro Max ‚Äî no complaints or no changes here to see. The display is extremely snappy and a lot of it is down to iOS 16 as well as Apple does handle animations much better than most of its competition does.If the refresh rate and other specs remain the same, then there‚Äôs something new in the form of the Always-on display. Better late than never, some may say. Apple is fashionably late but has arrived in some style. Now I am sure you must have read that some Android phone brought Always-on display first. Heck, even Google couldn‚Äôt resist the temptation to take a dig at Apple during its biggest hardware event of 2022. But Apple has created a perception that it isn‚Äôt in the rat race and that some features might not come first but they do come with a difference. Like the Always-on display.Apple‚Äôs implementation of Always-on display is unlike any other smartphone. What happens on the iPhone 14 Pro Max when Always-on display is turned on is that the lock screen is dimmed. ‚ÄúDisplay, display on the phone, who‚Äôs the prettiest of ‚Äòem all?‚Äù It‚Äôs the iPhone 14 Pro Max with the Always-on display. You can see notifications, lock screen widgets and everything else but it is subtly dimmed. If you have an iPhone and you use it for the first time, you might feel that was there a need for this? Not really but once you‚Äôve used it, I bet you will not be able to use the iPhone 14 Pro Max without toggling on the Always-on display.DYNAMIC ISLANDNow generally we tend to keep all display features in one sub-head but we are making an exception for the Dynamic Island. After all it is the belle of the ball, the headline act of the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Or at least it‚Äôs the most-talked about feature on this year‚Äôs iPhones. And it does deserve a separate section as it is delightfully done. The notch was Apple‚Äôs gift to the smartphone industry. The first year after the launch of iPhone X ‚Äî the first one with the notch ‚Äî Android brands made a beeline to adopt the notch as if Santa Claus handed it out on Christmas. But then Android phone makers came up with their really good iterations of it and Apple stuck with the notch until the Dynamic Island arrived with the iPhone 14 Pro models. And man, it is so well done that you just keep fiddling with it only for the first few days ‚Äî at least that‚Äôs what I found myself doing. The Dynamic Island is a different take on the notch and makes the use of that space which no one else ever thought of doing it before Apple. Not a fan of the name but this is a really cool feature to use and is not gimmicky at all.For someone who uses Apple Music a lot more than one should, the Dynamic Island is a treat. It will show the album artwork along the playback controls, and the waveform, AirPlay ‚Äî all in that tiny little space. If you are using any app and get an incoming call, then the Dynamic Island will show the alert and all the call controls. AirPods Pro‚Äôs battery life also appears in the Dynamic Island. Apple Maps directions also come on the Dynamic Island and so much so that at times I did ditch Google Maps for it because it looks really good.Apple has always had a way of showing all these notifications but never had a ‚Äòhome‚Äô ‚Äî which is now the Dynamic Island. In a few months, here‚Äôs hoping that other developers take advantage of the Dynamic Island as it is a really fun and useful feature. Apple is expected to launch Live Activities API soon and that‚Äôs when we will really see the Dynamic Island thrive and it is something that should get a lot of people excited. Is the feature good enough to pay the difference between the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro price? It certainly is if you want the complete iPhone experience.CAMERAIt has been well established that the iPhone cameras are one of the most consistent and versatile ones around. Apple seemed mightily reluctant to get in the megapixel race and remained steady with 12MP cameras. A case of better late than never yet again and once more Apple has done it differently. The primary camera now has a 48MP sensor, which produces some excellent images. All the images clicked from the 48MP camera have rich colours and look exceptionally vibrant and true to life. There are a lot of details captured especially in the images which were clicked using ProRAW. Like every other 48MP camera, Apple too uses pixel binning to give you 12MP images only but the ProRAW mode actually gives you 48MP images. And the difference is quite stark as more details are captured. But the trade-off is that images clicked with the 48MP camera consume a lot of space, like a lot. The photos we clicked ranged anywhere between 12MB to 42MB ‚Äî so use it rather judiciously. Of course, ProRAW is meant not just for utilising the 48MP camera.What works in the favour of the primary 48MP camera ‚Äî with and without pixel binning ‚Äî is the consistency it offers. You can be clicking in good lighting condition or not-so-good conditions, the iPhone 14 Pro Max delivers images that make you sit up and take note. Apple has certainly improved low-light photography as the iPhone 14 Pro Max does a wonderful job when the lights are dimmed. What the 48MP primary camera also gives is the option of 2x optical zoom lens ‚Äî a nice addition to the iPhone 14 Pro Max‚Äôs camera‚Äôs arsenal.The other 12MP cameras ‚Äî telephoto and ultra-wide ‚Äî also do a fine job of clicking images. Portraits clicked on the iPhone 14 Pro Max look great and bokeh effect is spot on. Apple‚Äôs computational photography has been a step ahead of others and on the iPhone 14 Pro Max you get the Photonic Engine. As per Apple, this is meant to improve colour reproduction and click better images in less light.The lack of zoom on the telephoto camera now does rankle a bit. The iPhone 14 Pro Max offers 3x zoom at a time when the likes of Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra can go up to 100x. I do wish Apple brings more zoom capabilities on the next iPhone as it is perhaps the only feature that is missing on these cameras.The Macro mode ‚Äî enabled automatically ‚Äî is a true delight on the iPhone 14 Pro Max. No one has done a better job with the macro mode than Apple as the results are truly excellent. Try capturing fabrics with the iPhone 14 Pro Max and the level of details is fascinating to see. You will find macro modes in so many smartphones‚Äô cameras but the iPhone 14 Pro Max is a cut above the rest.For the selfie/usfie/groupfie/whateverfie brigade, Apple has added a brand new camera. The 12MP camera now gets autofocus and it is really impressive. And it really shows in FaceTime calls or other video calls as well. There‚Äôs more clarity than there ever was on any iPhone. The front camera is a significant improvement on the iPhone 14 Pro Max.Where the iPhone 14 Pro Max‚Äôs camera really shines is videos. Apple brought Cinematic Mode last year with the iPhone 13 Pros and with the iPhone 14 Pros, you get the all-new Action Mode. No, it‚Äôs not a gimbal or anything like that. What it does is it really it offers really good stabilisation and that‚Äôs because Apple has improved EIS (electronic image stabilisation). You don‚Äôt get 4K recording with this mode as maximum resolution offered is 2.8K but it is still very good. The footage almost always remained really stable. The Cinematic Mode still remains great fun to use.Is this the best camera setup in any smartphone? Not exactly but it is certainly most versatile and consistent cameras in any smartphone. Almost every image is pleasing to look at and more than anything, the iPhone 14 Pro Max makes you want to click more images ‚Äî something that I can‚Äôt say about any other smartphone, except the Pixel phones.PERFORMANCE, BATTERY LIFEThis will be rather short and concise: the A-series Bionic processors on the iPhones have always been blazing fast and the iPhone 14 Pro Max with A16 is no different. The phone is a total powerhouse in every sense and handles all sorts of tasks comically well. You really can‚Äôt find any fault in the performance of the iPhone 14 Pro Max as it really is flawless. The iOS 16 experience is still getting refined so you might see a bug here and there but I expect Apple to sort that out soon.The iPhone 13 Pro Max by far had the best battery performance I have seen in all the phones reviewed in the last 12 months. Expectations were lofty from the iPhone 14 Pro Max and it was a rather bumpy start. In the first few days, with just under 5 hours of screen time, the phone had consumed close to 84% battery ‚Äî alarm bells did ring as Apple did tout the battery life of the iPhone 14 Pro Max. However after a few days normalcy was resumed as with six hours of screen time ‚Äî with Always-on enabled ‚Äî the iPhone 14 Pro Max still had 40% battery left. Does the Always-on display consume a lot of battery?Slightly but it‚Äôs not a battery guzzling feature. Overall, with a lot of streaming on Apple Music, Safari, WhatsApp, social media activities on a daily basis, the iPhone 14 Pro Max can really go on for a day ‚Äî and then some ‚Äî on a single charge.VERDICTApple has made a habit of making excellent smartphones and the iPhone 14 Pro Max is no different. There‚Äôs no escaping the fact that the iPhone 14 Pro Max is one of the most expensive smartphones you can buy ‚Äî starting at Rs 1,39,900 and goes up to Rs 1,89,900 (1TB storage variant). You might think that it will be a hard sell especially in a country like India. India still remains a vanilla iPhone island but the aspiration to go Pro is strong as ever.This year Apple has really separated the Pro models from the vanilla ones with the iPhone 14 series. And there is still an audience that salivates at the thought of getting an iPhone Pro ‚Äî perhaps they have used the vanilla and want an upgrade or they are the ones that just want the best of Apple.

Won‚Äôt bore you all with the geeky details which can be easily found on the web. All I can say the interface is way too smooth and the dynamic island is a funky lil feature that I love the most about this phone. The always on display is creatively done, stands out in the crowd, ppl instantly know which phone you‚Äôre carrying. Plus when the album art of Apple Music that stays in the AOD is a lovely lil touch. All in all if you can afford it, go for it. Believe me you‚Äôll not regret it, it is miles better than iPhone 12 and 13. The Pro models of iPhone 14 are definitely worth it.

I was already using iPhone 13 Pro Max from past 11 months and had say it is still the best value for money iPhone you can buy this time, at least in India considering huge price jump from previous models. I only purchased iPhone 14 Pro Max just because of ‚ÄúDynamic Island‚Äù and tbh i literally got bored after few minutes of using and experimenting with it. Well definitely it‚Äôs a fresh design but is it really worth paying almost 40K extra for that new notch? I would say go with 13 pro/max and save your money. Also I am surprised that this iphone is so demanding this year, if you have already planned to buy 14 pro/max then you have to wait for a month or so‚Ä¶it is literally out of stock from everywhere.

The battery-saving capability is also commendable. Considering its price range, it offers a satisfactory range of features.During the initial installation phase, we experienced significant delays in syncing Google contacts to the phone. Additionally, the device does not operate as swiftly as higher-end phones, as it is primarily designed for basic purposes. Expectations of exceptional speed should be tempered.

2990,"After using the device for exactly 7 days here's what I found -Starting first with the design and build quality, the device is quite the looker. It's very thin and lightweight and the curved edges make it very comfortable to hold on for longer periods.Also the glass sandwich built feels premium.Next coming to display, the 120 hz curved amoled panel is in one word, splendid. It offers an immersive viewing experience with buttery smooth output. It also supports up to 1300 nits of peak brightness which helps viewing in direct sunlight.Now, when you buy a IQOO device you don't have to worry about the performance. It shares the typical IQOO dna and is powered by MediaTek dimensity 7200. The processor is very capable in running daily tasks and graphic intensive games. I am not much of a hardcore gamer but so far what I have tested I'm impressed. Games like BGMI, COD, Genshin Impact runs smoothly in this device with good graphic settings. IQOO also has done a job in cooling the processor, it barely gets hot while gaming.Next coming to camera, it has a 64 megapixel rear sensor which offers very good photos in daylight as well as night time. And the 16 megapixel front sensor is good too. The rear sensor can do 4k 30fps video recording and the front is locked at 1080p 30fps. Now, I am not that much of a camera guy, watching a camera review of this device will surely give you a better idea.After that I would like to share my thoughts on the battery and charging department. I was a little concerned about the 4600mah battery capacity and the 120hz display combo but surprisingly the battery holds up pretty well. I get easily a whole day of usage with 6-7 hours of screen on time which also includes gaming. The 66w charging adaptor charges the device from 0 to 100 in about 55 minutes which I believe is pretty good.Coming to network and connectivity, I haven't really got the opportunity to test the 5G connectivity as my local area does no not have 5G network. But 4G plus career aggregation is very constant and it offers good uploading and downloading speeds.The last thing to talk is about software. The device comes with the latest Funtouch OS 13 based on Android 13 and IQOO has promised 2 years of OS and 3 years of security patches which is decent.Personally I don't like the Funtouch OS much. I am coming from OneUI and compared to that this OS feels a little bit less lively. The animations are fluid and it also has all the necessary features but it needs more polishing. Do note I haven't faced any bugs in the software but there are a few advertisements which you can turn off and then it becomes a very clean experience. The software experience completely varies from user to user so you might not be bothered by it at well. I just hope the brand polishes their UI more.Coming to compromises, it only has three which in my case is not much of an issue. It has an avarage vibration motor which doesn't offer flagship like experience. This device comes with a mono speaker which is decent. I'm coming from a device with a single speaker so it doesn't bother me as such. Also instead of the 2mp macro sensor a telephoto or ultrawide angle lens would have been highly appreciated.In conclusion, it can be said that it is a very good overall package if you can get it at 22k with the card offers. But for 24k it could've been better. It misses a few corners which would have made it perfect under 25k. I hope this review helps you to take a better purchasing decision.",4.0 out of 5 stars

My father primarily uses it for calls and essential communication, and even after two years, it's working flawlessly.The phone's performance has remained consistently smooth, and the call quality is crystal clear. Redmi has truly impressed me with the durability and reliability of this device. The battery life is exceptional, lasting through a full day with regular use without any hassle.What I appreciate the most is that Redmi has managed to offer a great product at a very reasonable price. For those who prioritize functionality and reliability over flashy features, this brand is an excellent option. The simplicity and user-friendly interface make it perfect for older individuals who mainly use their phone for calls.The build quality is sturdy, and the design is elegant. Redmi has certainly crafted a product that balances performance, affordability, and longevity.In summary, the Redmi 9 Activ Mobile is a fantastic choice for individuals seeking a dependable phone primarily for calls and essential communication.

3150,"As a retired (70s) person I needed a phone for Calling, Messaging, Entertainment, Browsing and Chrome casting. This phone is OK. But the weight of the phone gives pain in my fingers. Using Jio Router for WiFi. Although phone has dual band Wi-Fi capability, 2.4GHZ only gave a speed of 22 while 5GHZ gave full 30mbps. My old Realme phone only single band gives full 30 at the same spot. But overall it is still value for money for hard pressed oldies like me. On 22nd July, after 3 days of purchase I was pleased to receive MIUI 14 which is Android 13. Tested all features of Android 13 and so far no problems.I am writing again after 3 days of using MIUI 14 ie Android 13. Suddenly after 2 days my apps are behaving strangely. Calculator has no numeric pad, Battery Icon doesn't show %, drop down Status bar tray is showing only few icons. Immediately took it to MI service centre and new software was installed in 45 mts. and phone seems to work well with Android 13. Keeping fingers crossed. I have now visited MI Service Centre 3 times since my device was purchased on 19th July and still crashing. I hope MI will take up the matter seriously and not do a shoddy warranty job. I have not at all used the phone even for a single day.",4.0 out of 5 stars

3152,"Here is my honest review of the Redmi 12C smartphone:Pros:Good performance - The MediaTek Helio G85 processor and 4GB RAM provide smooth performance for day-to-day tasks and light gaming.Large display - It has a 6.71-inch HD+ display which is nice for watching videos and gaming. The teardrop notch is unobtrusive.Excellent battery life - With a large 5000mAh battery, the 12C can easily last 1.5-2 days of use on a single charge. Standby time is fantastic.Decent cameras - The 13MP rear and 5MP front cameras capture decent shots in good lighting conditions. The AI camera features are nice to have.Affordable price - Starting at just Rs. 8,999, the 12C offers good value considering the large display, battery and performance.Cons:Dated design - The thick bezels and plastic body make it look outdated compared to competitors. Build quality could be better.Average low-light photography - The cameras struggle in low light situations with visible noise. No ultra-wide or macro lens.Only 18W charging - Charging the large 5000mAh battery is slow with the included 18W charger. No support for faster charging.HD display - The display has only HD+ resolution (1600 x 720 pixels) resulting in less sharpness compared to Full HD displays.Overall, the Redmi 12C is a decent affordable smartphone for basic use and light gaming. It excels in battery life but has an outdated design and average camera performance. For the price, it's a good option for budget buyers who prioritize battery life and core performance. But those wanting better design or cameras can consider other options.",3.0 out of 5 stars
3153,"Camera does have 50 megapixel but you will get only portrait, normal, night, HDR and time lapse modes. I think night mode can be better.It is quite easy to use and is quite a sturdy one.It doesn't heat much but it can if you play high quality games which requires more functions like PUBG.Charging comes with normal one, there is no c type port and it takes its time to charge, no supercharge function.Appearance wise it's one of the best, you get great colour options and purple looks really good.I think this is a good budget phone.",4.0 out of 5 stars
3154,"Good built quality and appearance.Dislikes -many basic features that are only software related are also dropped for no reason.No new control center.Camera app don't have panorama, slow motion, document, AI modes. They are all software related not hardware which doesn't cost anything.Same way gallery editor is restricted of many common features like auto adjust image, colour focus filters etc.Auto brightness has some difficulty in adjustment.No live wallpaper,no always on display.Home screen grid is limited to only 4x4 and 5x5 in such a big screen. It should be atleast upto 5X7 option.No option to pin window or floating window, or split screen app option from recent menu.Hardware side -IR blaster, gyroscope sensor for compass, proximity sensor are missing for cost cutting.Type C charging port also dropped which is unbelievable.Extreme thick bazels and big lower space is just increased the size of phone.The weight is more than expected and size is also very big (even bigger than my redmi note 10 pro). God knows the reason behind making such bulky oversize phones. You cannot find any smaller size phone in the market.Screen quality, sound quality, camera quality are acceptable at this price range. No issue faced.Fingerprint sensor is at very high position, difficult to reach, and frequently you will touch camera lens instead of FP sensor because of the placement.Conclusion:On overall, it's basically a good hardware side purchase at this price range with very basic features (especially for elders and family members. But again too bulky for elders).On software side complete disappointment from MIUI for removing very basic features from its applications for no good reason.",3.0 out of 5 stars

3156,"I recently had the chance to explore the Redmi 12C in Matte Black, and my experience has been a combination of both positive and not-so-positive aspects. Here's a detailed breakdown:Pros:High-Performance Processor: The inclusion of the Mediatek Helio G85 processor brings a noticeable boost in performance, ensuring smoother multitasking and responsiveness.Excellent Battery Life: The battery life on the Redmi 12C is certainly a standout feature. It holds up impressively even during extended use, reducing the need for frequent charges.Cons:Display Performance: While the display is good overall, it falls short of being exceptional. Colors and clarity are satisfactory, but I expected a bit more vibrancy and sharpness.Sound Quality: Unfortunately, the sound quality did not meet my expectations. The audio output lacks the depth and richness I anticipated, which can impact the overall multimedia experience.MIUI OS: The MIUI operating system brings its own set of challenges. The user experience could be smoother, and certain functionalities, such as the contact search not showing recently added contacts and a delay in recent call history list updates, have been noticeable issues.Camera Performance: The camera's performance is average, offering acceptable results but not quite meeting the high standards set by other devices in this category.The Redmi 12C brings a mix of features to the table, with some aspects that shine and others that leave room for improvement. The high-performance processor and remarkable battery life are commendable, providing an enhanced user experience. However, areas like display vibrancy, sound quality, and the MIUI OS experience could use further refinement. While the camera captures moments adequately, it doesn't deliver exceptional results. For those seeking a budget-friendly option with a balance of strengths and weaknesses, the Redmi 12C could be considered. Keep in mind the trade-offs and decide based on your priorities.",4.0 out of 5 stars

3338,"I got this phone delivered the next day of ordering, as part of prime day sale. Writing this review after few days of use.Well the first impression about the back panel color is - it's blue rather than green! nevertheless it looks cool and feels premium. The glass finish is shiny, but I would recommend to use the rubber back cover that comes with the box. But you might have to invest to buy a transparent, bumper cover in the long run.Display - It is awesome as I keep looking the phone just to admire the different wall papers and text settings, etc. Colors are deep and rich! Almost zero bloatware.Battery - For a mild to medium user like me(about 3 Hrs of active usage), the battery has lasted for more than 24 Hrs. Also the fast charger works as expected. Full charge in less than an hour.Audio - Yes, I do miss the 3.5MM Jack especially as my old phone had that feature. However, the call quality through the device and through the BT earphones are ultra clear. No default music player app provided as in Samsung devices, but YT music/Spotify can fulfill your music needs. Hearing songs through built in speakers was goodIt comes with other bells and whistles like - favorite contacts widget, customizable always-on-display and in-display fingerprint sensor , battery saving mode, etc. I particularly like the fingerprint animation settings.Performance - well for my moderate usage I have not faced any problems so far. Stutter free scrolling, and apps are getting loaded in a jiffy and all the apps work smoothly; notifications work very well. Videos played well. Actually, nothing to complain here in these few days of usage.Camera - Honestly not able to test it in different conditions, but both day and night photos seem to come out well. Video calls quality is also great.Also, the phone does not feel heavy to hold. Even people with small hands should not have a problem in holding and operating the phone.I hope I can write a detailed review after few weeks of thorough usage. Thanks!",4.0 out of 5 stars
3339,This is a good phone and as expected it's pretty fast. I don't play games on the phone so I am not sure how it performs in that department. For general use its awesome.I do have one concern and that's the battery optimisation. Though it has huge battery sometimes it does not perform so well. Coming from OnePlus 7 I found that Nord 3 needs some battery optimisation.,4.0 out of 5 stars
3340,"The OnePlus Nord 3 5G has proven to be a noteworthy addition to my tech arsenal, offering a blend of premium features and solid performance. While it impresses on multiple fronts, there are a few areas that could use some refinement.Pros:Sleek and Sturdy Build: The OnePlus Nord 3 5G boasts an elegant and premium design that's a pleasure to hold. Its build quality is top-notch, and it feels like a truly high-end device.Vibrant Display: The display is a standout feature, with vibrant colors and sharp details that enhance the visual experience whether I'm watching videos, scrolling through social media, or gaming.Performance Powerhouse: Equipped with robust hardware, the Nord 3 delivers impressive performance, handling multitasking and demanding apps with ease. Lag and slowdowns are virtually non-existent.All-Day Battery: The battery life has been reliable, easily lasting through my day-to-day tasks and activities without needing frequent charging.Primary Camera Brilliance: The primary camera's performance is exceptional, capturing detailed and vibrant shots in various lighting conditions. It's a joy to use for photography enthusiasts.Clean and User-Friendly Software: OnePlus' OxygenOS continues to be a winner, offering a clean and intuitive user experience that enhances the overall usability of the device.Cons:Ultra-Wide Camera Performance: While the primary camera shines, the performance of the ultra-wide camera falls slightly short.

3341,"Since it's my first day. So, I haven't found any difficulty in using it. Just good phone. Since I am using OnePlus from last 4 years this phone is good but it can't be a flagship killer phone overall. Because it's camera and pictures quality are not such good. But it's processor is good which is mediatek dimensity 9000. So, it's performance is good as expected. I have buyed this phones 8GB Ram and 128GB storage version. Yes, it's good but price should be little much low at least 30,000. Or if it's price is 33999 then it's camera quality must be good enough and since after facing all prons and cons it good phone.

Colour science is accurate but it'll make reds more red, blue even bluer etc, that's what you need anyways.Of course night mode stunningly good.

Night mode is only for image not for Video recording.camera is like 12k rs range phone. you got only brand name and processor. one ui is ok.Overall camera spec -Rear 12 mp [1080p 30fps max rear and front.]- Front 12 mpYou can record 4k video in open camera. and you can also record 1080p 60fps in open camera.Main camera not support 4k video recording.i have problem with my m14 device, "" when i insert a micro sd card then phone restarting again and again.i have samsung sd card 256 gb.solution - when i inserted sd card in running phone then problem solve but after restarting the phone ,same problem created.display have low saturation and very low brightness . not visible in sun light.no any control for adjust saturation. my old nokia 3.1 plus display saturation is better than this 5g phone.wifi and hotspot not working at same time and setting is removed that allow this feature.Overall Good non chinese phone . you can also go for motog52 if you don't want 5g phone ,moto g52 is better for content watching.",4.0 out of 5 stars

3397,"Pros:- Fast charging, long lasting bettery- Touch screen experience- 5G speedCons:- The phone is bulky more than I expected- Camera quality is also average- No charger and they provide cable wire with both ends of type C which is useless without suitable adapter.. you can not connect the mobile with computer/laptop with this cable wire.At the time I got this phone there was software bug due to which I struggled with below problems for first 20 days:1. The screen clarity was not good.. the images were appearing more reddish/yellowish.. even video clarity was very poor.. the videos in 720p seemed more clear in my earlier phone M30s rather than videos in 1080p in this phone.2. In the name security the phone was hiding all the data & shows white screen (snap attached) when you switch between applications. you can only see app icons which is very hectic thing when you have type anything from one to another specially like otp or numbers..3. And the worst part was screenshot... the phone was not allowing me to take screenshot in any app or any case due its security policy...I complained on Samsung members app also contacted online samsung customer care but didn't help..(online support is worst.. they treats you like a old school guy like you know nothing about smartphone)After visiting Samsung Customer Care in person, they reseted the software. From thereon the phone is now working fine the problems as above are resolved.",3.0 out of 5 stars
3398,"I recently had the opportunity to use the latest smartphone model, and I must say that my experience was a mixed bag. While it does have some noteworthy features, there are several areas where improvements are needed.Starting with the positives, the battery backup of this device is commendable. It offers an impressive lifespan, allowing me to use it throughout the day without constantly worrying about running out of power. This is definitely a strong advantage for users who heavily rely on their smartphones for various tasks.However, I encountered a few drawbacks that significantly impacted my overall satisfaction. Firstly, the back panels of the device produce an unpleasant noise when held, which can be quite irritating and diminishes the overall quality of the phone. Additionally, the display did not meet my expectations. The visual quality and clarity fell short, resulting in a subpar viewing experience. This is an important aspect of any smartphone, and I was disappointed by the underwhelming display performance.Furthermore, the camera capabilities of the device were average at best. While it managed to capture decent photos in well-lit environments, it struggled in low-light situations, resulting in grainy and lackluster images. Considering the significance of smartphone photography in today's world, this is an area that could definitely benefit from improvement.Another frustrating aspect was the network connectivity issues. There were instances where the phone failed to establish a stable internet connection, necessitating a restart. This inconvenience disrupted my workflow and hindered my ability to access online content seamlessly. Additionally, I found the GPS to be unreliable, with frequent calibration problems and poor detection accuracy. This was particularly frustrating when relying on navigation apps or location-based services.",3.0 out of 5 stars

3428,"There is nothing I dislike about this phone. Only my expectations were too high after watching the several youtuber's reviews. Nothing special about this phone either. Hence the 3 star rating.I upgraded to this phone from a four year old Realme 3 (4/64 GB). But my old phone still beats this one in terms of speed. The 4000 mAH battery of Realme 3 gave me the same backup 4 years ago which this 6000 mAH in this phone gives me now.The phone comes with lots of bloatware. You can uninstall many of the useless apps. But there still remain many samsung apps which I don't use and I cannot uninstall. Samsung pay cannot store your credit card information. Only UPI and your IDs etc can be kept there. If you want to use credit card in any online transaction, you will still have to take the plastic card out of your pocket to punch in the details if you do not memorize it.The more weight and thickness of this phone are the only cons for me. But the promise of 4 years of software updates and robust service network nullify these cons.Overall, an average phone..",3.0 out of 5 stars

If you the gaming kind there are better phone for more price.The screen quality is good itseems, I don't really get into all those things.Tip: 15W instead of 25W charger would work well for longer battery life.At 25w it takes around 1hr 15mins to full charge.",4.0 out of 5 stars
3432,I didn't like the SIM tray setup. It's inconvenient to swap/change SIMs. Having a base to hold the SIMs in place would have been helpful.Biggest disappointment is on the exchange program. Amazon is relying on DA to assess the phone and they are always trying to reduce the value if they suspect a minor thing. I'm my case a discoloration corners was concluded as screen defect and was advised to pay the balance amount if wanted to go ahead with exchange. I was not given any payment receipt and informed that the information would be available on my Amazon account. It is still not available even after 5 days and it looks like I was tricked on this. I hope Amazon would be able to make this exchange program more reliable and trustworthy.,3.0 out of 5 stars

I choosed this smartphone because of its clean Android experience and ofcourse because of price point. It's just useful for normal day to day tasks.

So if someone who wants to give a decent smartphone to someone older than them or not for the geek one can go for this smartphone.Thank you üôÇ,5
